The highest resilience coeﬃcients at all organisational levels are obtained regarding safety awareness, safety training and safety communication areas, while the lowest values are observed for risk assessment and the organisational environment. The obtained results indicate that the ‘monitor’ resilience corner must be improved at all organisational levels, employees trained and procedures changed, since employees do not suﬃciently use experience from previous events. The very high values at all organisational levels of the coeﬃcients regarding the ‘anticipate’ and ‘learn’ resilience corners indicate organisational adaptation to changes through corrective activities, rather than planned preventive ones. All hierarchical levels have good resilience indicators, except for middle management, which expressed an adequate resilience index, due to the lower ratings of the safety training, organisational commitment, risk assessment and management support areas.","2024-04-02","2024-12-01 13:59:39","2024-12-01 13:59:39","2024-12-01 13:59:39","44-68","","1-2","41","","Civil Engineering and Environmental Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\YY6T5QMV\Alsharif et al. - 2024 - The safety climate, hierarchical levels and resili.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These tools are commonly associated with resilience metrics, which quantify the capacity of transport networks to withstand and absorb damage, recover after disruption and adapt to future changes. Several resilience metrics have been proposed in the literature, but there is lack of practical applications and worked examples. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap and provide engineers and novice researchers with a review of available metrics on the basis of the main properties of resilience (robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness and rapidity). The main steps of resilience assessment for transport infrastructure such as bridges are discussed and the use of fragility and restoration functions to assess the robustness and rapidity of recovery is demonstrated. Practical examples are provided using a bridge exposed to scour effects as a benchmark.

The vulnerability analysis of infrastructure exposed to natural hazards has become a key area of research due to the critical role that infrastructure plays for society and this topic has been the subject of significant advances from new data and insights following recent disasters. Transport systems, in particular, are highly vulnerable to natural hazards, and the physical damage of transport assets may cause significant disruption and socioeconomic impact. More importantly, infrastructure assets comprise Systems of Assets (SoA), i.e. a combination of interdependent assets exposed not to one, but to multiple hazards, depending on the environment within which these reside. Thus, it is of paramount importance for their reliability and safety to enable fragility analysis of SoA subjected to a sequence of hazards. In this context, and after understanding the absence of a relevant study, the aim of this paper is to review the recent advances on fragility assessment of critical transport infrastructure subject to diverse geotechnical and climatic hazards. The effects of these hazards on the main transport assets are summarised and common damage modes are described. Frequently in practice, individual fragility functions for each transport asset are employed as part of a quantitative risk analysis (QRA) of the infrastructure. A comprehensive review of the available fragility functions is provided for different hazards. Engineering advances in the development of numerical fragility functions for individual assets are discussed including soil-structure interaction, deterioration, and multiple hazard effects. The concept of SoA in diverse ecosystems is introduced, where infrastructure is classified based on (i) the road capacity and speed limits and (ii) the geomorphological and topographical conditions. A methodological framework for the development of numerical fragility functions of SoA under multiple hazards is proposed and demonstrated. The paper concludes by detailing the opportunities for future developments in the fragility analysis of transport SoA under multiple hazards, which is of paramount importance in decision-making processes around adaptation, mitigation, and recovery planning in respect of geotechnical and climatic hazards.","2019-11","2024-12-01 14:00:04","2024-12-01 14:00:04","2024-12-01 14:00:04","106567","","","191","","Reliability Engineering & System Safety","Fragility of transport assets exposed to multiple hazards","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\JTRQXN57\Argyroudis et al. - 2019 - Fragility of transport assets exposed to multiple .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indirect losses can be severe because the breakdown of a transportation network aggravates rescue, supply, and other recovery activities. The operations and logistics of rural networks that are under seismic risks must be managed using the limited resources speciﬁcally in developing countries. We propose a methodology to evaluate road recovery strategies for restoring connectivity after blockages due to earthquakes and earthquake-triggered landslides. This paper gives insight into the recovery process, which can be used by decision-makers for enhancing resilience and supplying immediate relief to rural areas. The proposed framework has four steps: 1) identiﬁcation of strategies for increasing recovery performance, 2) determination of graph-based metrics to represent network connectivity, 3) applying topology-based and Monte Carlo simulations to each strategy, and 4) analysis of recovery times to compare these resilience-enhancement strategies. The methodology was tested using a case study from Sindhupalchok District, Nepal, a region that was severely aﬀected by the Gorkha earthquake in 2015. The closed road segments and recovery times were determined through ﬁeld surveys with locals and governmental authorities, and by investigating the intensity of earthquake-triggered landslides. Our results showed that the proposed approach provides information about the recovery behavior of road networks and simpliﬁes the evaluation process.

Research in transport has already incorporated the concept of resilience with more or less sophisticated approaches that are intensive on data and technical expertise. There is a need to explore the incorporation of resilience in simpler and less data intensive methods that can be easily applied in a wider range of contexts. One of the aims of this research is to develop a method that can use commonly available mobility management tools allowing smaller urban areas to analyse and plan for resilience. We present a new development of a method to assess resilience in transport systems with a commonly used mobility management tool (the origin-destination matrix) for calculating an overall measurement of resilience. The method assumes that car trips are transferred to active modes or to the available public transport routes in the event of any disruption in the system. We consider diﬀerent scenarios of availability of public transport in case of disruptive events. We applied the method to two urban areas in Brazil. The variation of the contribution of the public transport presents patterns comparable between the two cases. The spatial distribution of trips shows the relative importance of resilient trips and the cities’ spatial structure. The inclusion of public transport routes has an impact on the levels of accessibility of lower income users.","2020-08","2024-12-01 14:00:14","2024-12-01 14:00:14","2024-12-01 14:00:14","102386","","","85","","Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\Z8VN3TV8\Azolin et al. - 2020 - Incorporating public transport in a methodology fo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The disaster-induced effects on road links and their subsequent recovery to the pre-disaster state are functions of the designed network resilience. Thus, the investigation of traffic operations including speed and volume fluctuations during such disasters can provide useful insights into the resilience of the roadway network. Furthermore, identifying road links and corridors which are most affected during natural disasters and estimating the extent of the effect on traffic are crucial steps in devising traffic management strategies for mitigating future hazards. A key challenge to the realization of the above objectives is the lack of data pertaining to roadway and traffic conditions during natural disasters. While modern sensing technologies based on non-Dedicated Short-Range (wireless) Communications such as Bluetooth® have been widely adopted to track traffic performance, they need to be corroborated with supplementary data for a complete characterization of the prevalent traffic conditions. In this study, an alter­ native method is presented for identifying the traffic fluctuations induced by a natural disaster (Hurricane Harvey) on an urban traffic network (Houston) by studying the characteristics of extreme travel time observa­ tions. The study relies on time series decomposition and anomaly detection algorithms to investigate the spatiotemporal effects of the hurricane on the traffic conditions. The results of the case study suggest that the metrics developed are effective in quantifying the resilience of traffic networks against natural disasters by capturing both the initial impact and recovery. The study showed that the Houston freeway network was not completely recovered from the effects of Hurricane Harvey, even three weeks after the occurrence of the hurricane.","2020-08","2024-12-01 14:00:18","2024-12-01 14:00:19","2024-12-01 14:00:18","101565","","","47","","International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\XQXS2VVU\Balakrishnan et al. - 2020 - Mapping resilience of Houston freeway network duri.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result of uncertainty in roadway capacity, an urban road network can be deemed to operate at different capacity levels. Some of these levels will have unused capacity, whereas some others will not be enough to cater trafﬁc from all origins to all destinations. Past models assume knowledge over the pattern of these uncertainties. However, it is difﬁcult to gather such knowledge from ﬁeld observations, and it is absent for majority of the world's urban areas. We present an alternative methodology in which the capacities are considered as variables that can take any value from zero to a practically realizable maximum. Using a minimax optimization formulation, we determine bounds on urban roadway capacity levels, below which the trafﬁc demand will go unmet. We call this the critical state, and deﬁne it as a state of link capacities which effects in the maximum irreducible operational cost on the network with the demand getting fulﬁlled. We prove that at a critical state, the total travel time (or cost) of the system will be a unique value; i.e. for a given urban road network and a given trafﬁc demand, there is an associated unique critical travel time. We illustrate that this unique travel time—which is an aggregate value of the travel times from all roads on the network—can be used as a benchmark to create various metrics for the urban road network. As an illustrative example on the applicability of critical state, we compare the unique travel time with the best possible travel time on the network, and develop a metric for network resilience. Network resilience is calculated as a normalized difference of the critical and best operation costs. Two-space genetic algorithm is used to solve the problem formulation. The formulation and the solution methodology are illustrated on test networks and results are presented.","2015-11","2024-12-01 14:00:23","2024-12-01 14:00:24","2024-12-01 14:00:23","108-118","","","54","","Computers, Environment and Urban Systems","Capacity uncertainty on urban road networks","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\EGBKCE3U\Bhavathrathan and Patil - 2015 - Capacity uncertainty on urban road networks A cri.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The concept of resilience in urban mobility is under intensive research with increasingly more sophisticated approaches and methods being developed to assess resilience in transport modes due to different shocks. The literature is, however, absent on applications aimed at using simpler mobility indicators that are used and validated in urban mobility planning processes in the context of lack of data or expertise. We propose a resilience evaluation method that uses commonly available origin–destination (OD) datasets to evaluate an overall indicator of resilience. We consider the possibility of trips made in motorised modes to be transferred to active modes in the event of a disruption of the mobility system. Results of the application of the method to two urban areas in Brazil show that each one has a specific pattern of mode change that is related to the OD patterns.

The most commonly utilized metrics are network efficiency and criticality that examine the impact that the removal of a structural element of a graph/ network has on its operation. Efficiency examines this term from a pure topological aspect and takes into account the shortest paths between the nodes whereas, on the other hand, criticality takes into account transportation-related variables like travel demand. In the present research, the interrelation between efficiency and criticality is further examined through a series of simulation experiments on the Athens city-center urban road network. For the quantification of efficiency, vulnerability, and criticality an iterative approach is used where, per iteration, one link of the network was removed.

There is increased need for adaptation to maintain current asset conditions and services, and a strategic requirement to prioritise such investments in adaptation to reduce future risks. Physical network risks will not be evenly distributed across nations (e.g. due to geographical and climate change patterns), and some regions will require more investment and adaptive interventions than others to maintain services due their vulnerability to natural hazards. Comparatively, the distribution of investment for transport infrastructure does not have a uniform spatial distribution, and can favour schemes that reduce congestion on networks with high demand without considering the actual risk of being impacted. These two issues, if unchallenged, will present an unfavourable future for areas with high network risks and low transport demand that will widen spatial inequality or resilience, mobility and potential for economic growth. This study advances a methodological framework to analyse the spatial distribution of flood risk on UK road and rail networks in the light of potential bias of regional investment. Using GIS mapping, network data and risk analysis, regional futures are categorised and discussed. There is a clear North/South divide in transport networks at risk from potential coastal and fluvial flooding, with southern regions having 10–30% of their network situated in known flood risk areas. Investment in transport infrastructure is also disproportionately favoured towards regions with high transport demand, and peripheral regional such as Wales and the South West are at risk from increase disparity from high flood risk networks and a low potential for investment. The study provides preliminary evidence for the need to consider assessment approaches for long-term investment in resilience, drawing recommendations for future research.","2018-09-30","2024-12-01 14:01:03","2024-12-01 14:01:03","2024-12-01 14:01:03","515-527","","4","8","","Int.

The granularity of the GPS data necessary for the method is relatively coarse; it only requires coordinates for the beginning and end of trips, the metered distance, and the total travel time. The method works by computing the historical distribution of pace (normalized travel times) between various regions of a city and measuring the pace deviations during an unusual event. Periods of time containing extreme deviations are identiﬁed as events. The method is applied to a dataset of nearly 700 million taxi trips in New York City, which is used to analyze the city transportation infrastructure resilience to Hurricane Sandy. The analysis indicates that Hurricane Sandy impacted trafﬁc conditions for more than ﬁve days, and caused a peak delay of two minutes per mile. Practically, it identiﬁes that the evacuation announcements coincided with only minor disruptions, but signiﬁcant delays were encountered during the post-disaster response period.

Finally, multinomial logit and bivariate probit models are estimated to identify the main drivers of change. Our study ﬁnds that female headed households are less likely to become the most resilient; also this paper demonstrates that education and participation to household enterprises are positively associated with increased resilience capacity. This paper innovates the resilience literature by providing an evidence based analysis of the main drivers of resilience; it brings this evidence in the Uganda’s context, focusing the attention of the policy makers on sub-sample of population which are worse off.

Whereas typical policy responses prioritize reduction of delays under normal conditions to improve the efficiency of urban road systems, analytic support for investments that improve resilience (defined as system recovery from additional disruptions) is still scarce. In this effort, we represent paved roads as a transportation network by mapping intersections to nodes and road segments between the intersections to links. We built road networks for 40 of the urban areas defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. We developed and calibrated a model to evaluate traffic delays using link loads. The loads may be regarded as traffic-based centrality measures, estimating the number of individuals using corresponding road segments. Efficiency was estimated as the average annual delay per peak-period auto commuter, and modeled results were found to be close to observed data, with the notable exception of New York City. Resilience was estimated as the change in efficiency resulting from roadway disruptions and was found to vary between cities, with increased delays due to a 5% random loss of road linkages ranging from 9.5% in Los Angeles to 56.0% in San Francisco. The results demonstrate that many urban road systems that operate inefficiently under normal conditions are nevertheless resilient to disruption, whereas some more efficient cities are more fragile. The implication is that resilience, not just efficiency, should be considered explicitly in roadway project selection and justify investment opportunities related to disaster and other disruptions.","2017-12","2024-12-01 14:01:49","2024-12-01 14:01:49","2024-12-01 14:01:49","e1701079","","12","3","","Sci.

These systems combine connectivity, coordination, adaptivity, and automated response for transportation policy optimization, thus increasing “smartness” and efficiency. However, the control and sensing systems of implemented ITS can open new vulnerabilities, especially to cyber-attacks. Currently vulnerability is managed within the framework of traditional risk assessment that assesses potential failures of the system in response to specified threats. Emerging technologies by their nature have threats that are not fully known, therefore, resilience, defined as the system's ability to recover and adapt to both known and unknown threats, is an emerging area that holds promise for assessing threats to ITS. To illustrate the applicability of resilience to ITS, we conducted a study of network efficiency and resilience in response to random and targeted disruptions of ITS systems in 10 urban areas. Disruptions were generated to affect either intersections or roadways controlled by ITS under different threat scenarios. Modeled attacks, under worst case scenarios, disrupted 20% of intersections causing on average 14.6% more additional delays than the same severity attacks on roadways. Additionally, locking traffic signal states was found to cause more disruption than fully disabling signals.

The resilience of urban transportation networks, i.e. the ability to recover from destroyed conditions, is thus significant for the mobility of passengers and freight in cities. However, its definition and measurement have been confused with robustness. This research advances a trackable assessment framework for the resilience of two typical urban transportation modes, i.e. road system and metro system, considering the characteristics of their structure and functionality. Individual vertex-based and edge-based failure models are established for the two transportation systems based on their network models. The proposed measurement approach is applied to an inner-city road freight system and the metro system in Hangzhou, China, to analyse their resilience, considering different combinations of vertex-based and edge-based failures. The proposed approach is compared with an efficiency-based resilience measurement method and outperforms in two parts. First, it has a broader application than previous related methods because it can describe disruptions occurring on one directed vertex or edge using a directed network model. Second, the new method outputs more reliable results due to considering more structural and functional characteristics of urban transportation systems than previous methods.","2021-04-03","2024-12-01 14:01:58","2024-12-01 14:01:58","2024-12-01 14:01:58","2177-2192","","7","59","","International Journal of Production Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\J64PCGZK\Gao and Wang - 2021 - A resilience assessment framework for urban transp.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The framework considers dependencies pertaining to failure propagation, system-of-systems architecture and resources required for operating and repairing assets. Stochastic asset failure is captured by a scenario tree generation algorithm whereas the redistribution of network flows and the optimal deployment of repair resources are modelled using a minimum cost flow approach.

Disruptions to critical infrastructures have impaired the ability to ensure sustainable daily operations and have caused further failures in other systems. Along with resource allocation and pre-evacuation, highway networks profoundly impact disaster response and recovery, particularly emergency disaster logistics and rescues. This study reviews the highway vulnerability assessments in Taiwan and examines the resilience of highway networks in regard to failures from the perspectives of interdependency. Analytical results demonstrate that the accessibility of emergency medical facilities plays an essential role in highway resilience in Taiwan. Moreover, the connectivity is critical for metropolitan road network resilience, whereas remote highway resilience is associated with the exposures with insufficient self-protection capacities.

Such analysis can allow detection of unusual patterns due to an extreme event and to analyze resilience of the transportation network.

This paper investigates the current state of the art for assessments on urban surface transport, where rising populations and increasing dependence on efficient and reliable mobility have increased the importance placed on resilience to weather. The standard structure of climate change impact assessment (CIA) requires understanding in three important areas: how weather currently affects infrastructure and operations; how climate change may alter the frequency and magnitude of these impacts; and how concurrent technological and socio-economic development may shape the transport network of the future, either ameliorating or exacerbating the effects of climate change. The extent to which the requisite knowledge exists for a successful CIA is observed to decrease from the former to the latter. This paper traces a number of developments in the extrapolation of physical and behavioural relationships on to future climates, including a broad move away from previous deterministic methods and towards probabilistic projections which make use of a much broader range of climate change model output, giving a better representation of the uncertainty involved. Studies increasingly demand spatially and temporally downscaled climate projections that can represent realistic sub-daily fluctuations in weather that transport systems are sensitive to. It is recommended that future climate change impact assessments should focus on several key areas, including better representation of sub-daily extremes in climate tools, and recreation of realistic spatially coherent weather. Greater use of the increasing amounts of data created and captured by ‘intelligent infrastructure’ and ‘smart cities’ is also needed to develop behavioural and physical models of the response of transport to weather and to develop a better understanding of how stakeholders respond to probabilistic climate change impact projections.","2014-08","2024-12-01 14:02:44","2024-12-01 14:02:44","2024-12-01 14:02:44","448-463","","4","38","","Progress in Physical Geography: Earth and Environment","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\3DVDPLQ6\Jaroszweski et al. - 2014 - The impact of climate change on urban transport re.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Waze data and people-centric methods facilitate the analysis and help improve our understanding of realistic transportation system behavior in response to a disruptive event (i.e., accidents and traffic jams). Using the proposed approach, the resilience has been quantified for selected highway sections in Washington, DC area by using reports of delays, caused by disruptive events. The changes in travel time were used as the base for resilience quantification. The accident and traffic jam reports were collected and used as the performance indicators of the model.

Also, the measures require full microscopic simulations for deriving the value of travel time increase, which is used for predicting network performance in case a disaster situation occurs. In order to overcome such issue, this study provides a new evaluation method for vulnerability of urban road network based on the concept of macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD). We call such measure as MFD-based Vulnerability Index (MVI), which is derived by comparing the MFD behaviours in normal condition and event condition, in which one or more links of a road network are failed by a disaster. For testing the measure, a simulation study based on the road network of Gangnam district, Seoul, South Korea is provided.

Currently, most mandated developmentrelated transportation planning is intended to prepare for frequently occurring and observable disruptions while low probability events that have not yet materialized attract less attention. When road networks are not resilient, i.e., they do not recover rapidly from disruptions, these unpredictable events can cause significant delays that may not be proportional to the extent of the disruption. Enhancing resilience can help in mitigating consequences of disruptions but requires financial investment that is difficult to justify given that low probability event may not have materialized. This paper highlights economic implications of unmitigated random disruptions in urban road systems and makes the case for investment in transportation network resilience. We utilized a model of urban transportation network performance that quantifies resilience and demonstrated its integration with microeconomic transportation planning model REMI TranSight. The model was applied to 10 cities in the USA to calculate several economic indicators under baseline scenario where economic impact was assumed to be proportional to the magnitude of disruptive events and under a test scenario where the magnitude of disruption was used to calculate additional delays in transportation networks and these additional delays were explicitly integrated in REMI model. Results show that GDP losses suffered as a result of disruption may be far more significant in the case scenario and economic output is not necessarily back to normal in the year the following disruptive event. We thus conclude that support for investment decisions on network efficiency and resilience management should be based on a framework that utilizes resilience, quantified in terms that are compatible with standard practice, and scenarios to test the implications of topological attributes.","2020-09","2024-12-01 14:03:03","2024-12-01 14:03:03","2024-12-01 14:03:03","102419","","","86","","Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment","Lack of resilience in transportation networks","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\SGLRRNLT\Kurth et al. - 2020 - Lack of resilience in transportation networks Eco.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With growing costs of service failure, it has become increasingly important to evaluate the dynamic operability characteristics, i.e., the dynamic resilience, of road networks. However, existing studies in this field generally considered a one-time disaster event during a relatively short period, and thus became insufficient for assessing the resilience of road networks in an extreme environment with frequent disaster events. This paper aims to propose a Time-dependent Resilience Analysis Framework (TIDRAF) by modeling the dynamic resilience of a road network in an extreme environment (where there are frequent disruptive events) and sequential repair actions. The original resilience triangle diagram is extended into a long-term paradigm to fit the road network with its frequentdisaster environment. The road network in the Tibetan Plateau, which has for years severely suffered from frequent disaster events, was selected as the case to validate the proposed TIDRAF.

This paper presents a method for investigating how the ATN responds to the COVID-19 pandemic from its outbreak through deterioration, adaptation, and restoration. The concept of system state is introduced to investigate when the ATN has substantially changed. By comparing the structure of the temporal ATN in different weeks based on network similarity assessment, the changing points of the ATN are detected, where the network system has switched from one state to another. To quantify what are the changes to the ATN’s structure, several performance metrics, including global and local connectivity, are evaluated around the changing points. Moreover, to study the response time of the ATN to the pandemic, the time lag between the changing points of the ATN and that of the confirmed cases is examined. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the ATNs of Mainland China and the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in some interesting findings and policy implications. It is found that in a pandemic outbreak, China is more likely to suspend routes directly, while the U.S. is reducing flight fre­ quency to maintain essential airport connections. Further, the state transition of ATNs caused by policies is temporary, while the state change caused by the pandemic is permanent.","2023-11","2024-12-01 14:03:17","2024-12-01 14:03:17","2024-12-01 14:03:17","103836","","","177","","Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice","How air transport networks respond to long-lasting disruptive events like COVID-19","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\56H7HKEZ\Li et al. - 2023 - How air transport networks respond to long-lasting.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under disasters, transportation infrastructure plays an important role in emergency management; however, this infrastructure is also vulnerable because of disasters. One way to describe the vulnerable is through resilience. Resilience refers to the ability to recover from a disruption under unexpected conditions, such as natural and/or man-made disasters. How to enhance resilience of transportation infrastructure under disasters is an important issue when facing natural or man-made disasters. This study aims to measure and optimize transportation resilience under disasters. An optimization model for resilience under the constraints of budget and traversal time is proposed. One special feature is that preparedness and recovery activities are implicitly considered and incorporated within the optimization model. The mathematical model provides a good connection between preparedness/recovery activities and network-level resilience. In order to illustrate the proposed model, a real city network and assumptions on activities of emergency management are used in a series of numerical experiments. Trafﬁc conditions before and after disasters are evaluated by the simulation-assignment model, DynaTAIWAN. Experiments and results illustrate advantages for network-level transportation resilience assessment and also prioritize preparedness and recovery activities under budget constraints.","2018-08","2024-12-01 14:03:22","2024-12-01 14:03:22","2024-12-01 14:03:22","469-489","","1","93","","Nat Hazards","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\9GHJ57XC\Liao et al. - 2018 - A resilience optimization model for transportation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, we built a nonlinear load-capacity model and a cascading failure model to reflect the dynamic feature of resilience. Next, attack scenarios were designed ac­ cording to the actual characteristics of the multi-mode public transit. Using the passenger flow data from Xi’an, we tested the impact of station capacity on the dynamic resilience results and analyzed the resilience evolution process. The results indicate that the network’s resilience performance was the worst when the subway station was destroyed. Through adjusting the capacity control parameters, we found the best station capacity control parameter is α = 0.5, β = 0.4. Moreover, the sharply reducing intervals found in the results could help traffic managers improve transport efficiency while controlling costs.","2022-05","2024-12-01 14:03:26","2024-12-01 14:03:27","2024-12-01 14:03:26","131350","","","348","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\6H9ZNKID\Liu et al. - 2022 - Evaluating the dynamic resilience of the multi-mod.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Transportation systems have largely been designed and operated for historical climate conditions that are now often exceeded. Emerging knowledge of how to plan for climate change largely embraces risk-based thinking favoring more robust infrastructure designs. However, there remain questions about whether this approach is sufficient given the uncertainty and non-stationarity of the climate, and many other driving factors affecting transportation systems (e.g., funding, rapid technological change, population and utilization shifts, etc.). This paper examines existing research and knowledge related to the vulnerability of the transportation system to climate change and extreme weather events and finds that there are both direct and indirect “pathways of disruption.” Direct pathways of disruption consist of both abrupt impacts to physical infrastructure and impacts via non-physical factors such as human health, behavior, and decision making. Similarly, indirect pathways of disruption result from interconnections with other critical infrastructure and social systems. Currently, the direct pathways appear to receive much of the focus in vulnerability and risk assessments, and the predominant approach for addressing these pathways of disruption emphasizes strengthening and armoring infrastructure (robustness) guided by risk analysis. However, our analysis reveals that indirect pathways of disruption can have meaningful impacts, while also being less amenable to robustness-based approaches. As a result, we posit that concepts like flexibility and agility appear to be well suited to complement the status quo of robustness by addressing the indirect and non-physical pathways of disruption that often prove challenging - thereby improving the resilience of transportation systems.","2019-02","2024-12-01 14:03:48","2024-12-01 14:03:48","2024-12-01 14:03:48","174-186","","","74","","Transport Policy","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\ZG3SFW74\Markolf et al. - 2019 - Transportation resilience to climate change and ex.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Loss of the functionality of bridges has consequences on the entire transport network, which is also interconnected with other networks, therefore cascading events are expected in the entire system of systems, leading to significant economic losses, business, and societal disruption. Recent natural disasters revealed the vulnerabilities of bridges and CTI to diverse hazards (e.g. floods, blasts, earthquakes), some of which are exacerbated due to climate change. Therefore, the assessment of bridge and network vulnerabilities by quantifying their capacity and functionality loss and adaptation to new requirements and stressors is of paramount importance. In this paper, we try to understand what are the main compound hazards, stressors and threats that influence bridges with short- and long-term impacts on their structural capacity and functionality and the impact of bridge closures on the network operability. We also prioritise the main drivers of bridge restoration and reinstatement, e.g. its importance, structural, resources, organisational factors. The loss of performance, driven by the redundancy and robustness of the bridge, is the first step to be considered in the overall process of resilience quantification. Resourcefulness is the other main component of resilience here analysed.","2022-09","2024-12-01 14:03:55","2024-12-01 14:03:56","2024-12-01 14:03:55","138-149","","3","175","","Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers - Bridge Engineering","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\ICXGRDSX\Mitoulis et al. - 2022 - Bridge and transport network resilience – a perspe.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The indicator that accounts for performance and recovery pattern under disruptive events is known as resilience. This paper presents a methodology to assess the resilience of a trafﬁc network when a given perturbation occurs, from the beginning of the perturbation to the total system recovery. To consider the dynamic nature of the problem, a new dynamic equilibrium-restricted assignment model is presented to simulate the network performance evolution, which takes into consideration important aspects, such as the cost increment due to the perturbation, the system impedance to alter its previous state and the user stress level.

In the transportation infrastructure, system shocks due to manmade and natural causes occur frequently and result in substantial economic losses; it is therefore crucial to enhance the resiliency of this infrastructure. Improving the resiliency of systems creates a need for developing metrics that measure the current resiliency of the system and to provide a benchmark for evaluating different strategies for improving resiliency. In this paper, we propose a framework for assessing the resiliency of a regional road network. The methodology introduced in this paper is the Networked Infrastructure Resiliency Assessment (NIRA) framework, which allows decision-makers to assess the resiliency of networked infrastructures from a multi-metric perspective. The resiliency metrics measure the impact of disruptions on the system performance measures. The three identified metrics for road networks are the travel time resiliency, environmental resiliency and cost resiliency. The resiliency values are measured by introducing hypothetical disruptions to a network model of a regional transportation network. The NIRA framework is applied to the transportation corridor between Boston and New York City.

The built environment and transport infrastructure of an urban form determine the extent to which low-impact adaptations to these constraints are possible and hence the resilience of residents to fuel price shocks and constraints. This paper introduces the concept of active mode accessibility (AMA), defined as the proportion of activities that can be reached by active modes alone, given the population demographics of the study area. AMA is characterized by the underlying geographic form of an urban area and its transport networks. High AMA means that the resident transport activity system can be served with minimal energy input; consequently resilience to fuel shocks and constraints is greater. The AMA method is based on accessibility analysis and extends the depth of the analysis with energy-based activity modeling and defines a measure of energy accessibility. The paper introduces a spatial method for calculating the AMA within a selected study area and a geographic information system–based tool for applying the method, and presents two case studies. Central Christchurch, New Zealand, gives an AMA of 100% because the city has a high density of destinations and a wide range of local facilities available for every activity. The satellite township of Rolleston gives a significantly lower AMA of 59%, principally because of a lack of local preschool and high school facilities and an insufficient diversity of destinations for some activities.","2011-01","2024-12-01 14:04:30","2024-12-01 14:04:30","2024-12-01 14:04:30","72-80","","1","2242","","Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board","Quantifying Transport Energy Resilience","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\7AHMFBLJ\Rendall et al. - 2011 - Quantifying Transport Energy Resilience Active Mo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article measures the level of resilience and vulnerability due to the absence of public transport fare subsidies. For this purpose, we developed an approach based on fuzzy logic and applied it in 33 administrative regions (ARs) of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We obtained four matrices of the levels of vulnerability and resilience of each of the regions as an origin and destination. The results show that areas nearest to the downtown region and those with high-capacity transportation available (commuter train and/or subway, systems with many transfer points) are more resilient, while a high level of vulnerability is associated with low income, negative socioeconomic indicators, and the predominance of road transportation to reach jobs.

Many scholars have focused on transportation network resilience because of its importance in society’s wellbeing and recovery efforts after disturbances. Existing studies have suggested various definitions, indicators, and methods for assessing the resilience of transportation networks. This variation is due to differences in the nature, scale, and impact of disturbances. This systematic literature review presents resilience assessment methods for transportation networks, indicators, and disturbance categories. A new representation is suggested for the relationships between performance, time, and resilience, emphasizing other network characteristics and their association with resilience. Resilience indicators are categorized, and disturbance categories are analyzed. Approaches are grouped based on their methodologies and presenting their strengths and limitations. This paper directs future studies toward investigating emerging threats, including climate change, pandemics, cybersecurity, failure propagation, and the impacts of new technologies and paradigms on urban transportation resilience. Additionally, it highlights the benefits of identifying a reference metric.

Conse­ quently, understanding the resilience of transportation networks following a natural disaster is crucial. This research proposes a new Trip Resilience (TR) measure to assess the resilience of trips on road networks following a disaster, integrating all three dimensions of resilience, namely robustness, redundancy, and recovery. The methodological approach includes an analysis of existing transport resilience measures presented in the literature to assess their ability to quantify robustness, redundancy and recovery in terms of the proposed conceptual model. The analytical formulations of the individual component measures are then developed, or adapted from previous research, along with a means of integrating all three into a combined Trip Resilience (TR) measure. A case study methodological approach is then adopted to verify the practicality of the proposed measures using the outcomes from a transportation simulation of a hypothetical Alpine Fault Magnitude 8 (AF8) scenario. A Nor­ malised Trip Resilience (NTR) measure is also proposed that converts the TR to a normalised scale that is easily understandable to decision-makers. Finally, in order to facilitate ranking of the post-disaster impact on districts, a new measure, namely the Equivalent daily number of Impacted Trips (EIT), is proposed. The proposed measure provides an opportunity for decision-makers to estimate and rank the trip resilience between each (group of) Origin-Destination pair(s) using pre- and post-disaster flow and travel time. The resulting measures were capable of being calculated from the outputs produced by the transportation simulation model in the case study, thereby verifying their practicality in real-world situations. The importance of including both robustness (represented by the number of eliminated trips) and redundancy (represented by increased travel time), over the horizon of the post-disaster recovery phase was highlighted. Eliminated trips contributed significantly in areas that were cut off and isolated post-disaster, due to a lack of alternative routes, and increased travel time contributed as more roads were reopened but the alternative routes resulted in increased travel distances and, consequently, travel time.","2021-07","2024-12-01 14:04:42","2024-12-01 14:04:42","2024-12-01 14:04:42","103154","","","95","","Journal of Transport Geography","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\YRI8ILF6\Aghababaei et al. - 2021 - Measures to evaluate post-disaster trip resilience.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study focuses on the quantiﬁcation of improved reliability, which reduces the time of annealing and recovery post uncertain disruption. A reliability model is presented by using three performance functions that estimate the total travel time, ﬂow, and consumer surplus. Network reliability is estimated by considering uncertainties in link-capacity and demand sensitivity with respect to travel time, following a disaster. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are conducted to identify the most crucial links in the transportation network, for which resistance should be increased to mitigate disaster risk. The simulation results show that the model provides accurate predictions of the system performance, and that a reliability model that accounts for uncertainty yields better results than a deterministic (no uncertainty) model. With higher accuracy models, planners are able to make informed decisions in disaster mitigation planning.","2015-12","2024-12-01 14:04:56","2024-12-01 14:04:56","2024-12-01 14:04:56","536-544","","","14","","International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","Estimation of road network reliability on resiliency","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\A2NS5Y95\Soltani-Sobh et al. - 2015 - Estimation of road network reliability on resilien.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents an approach for evaluating the performance reliability, considering the uncertainty in both demand and supply sides of the road network due to an unexpected event. These uncertainties are likely due to the effect of natural disasters on road networks. On the supply side, in addition to link capacity, environment parameters of roads, which indirectly inﬂuence parameters of link travel time, are degraded after disasters. Road environment parameters, such as visibility, geometric, pavement condition, and safety elements, impact road capacity by a perceived increased cost or inability to travel. A generalized link travel cost is suggested to capture these effects. On the demand side, elastic demand is modeled with lognormal distribution and a logit-based stochastic user equilibrium is formulated to presents the traveler's uncertain behavior in route choice. In this study, the ﬁrst order second moment reliability method is used to evaluate network reliability. This paper presents a numerical example that shows the result of ignoring uncertainties after a disaster is overestimated. Also, it was observed that increasing variation of demand and supply decreases the network performance and network reliability, and the increasing knowledge of the user in route choice behavior increases the network efﬁciency.","2016-08","2024-12-01 14:05:00","2024-12-01 14:05:00","2024-12-01 14:05:00","128-136","","","17","","International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\HBEKI9S9\Soltani-Sobh et al. - 2016 - Evaluation of transportation network reliability d.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extending concepts from fault trees and binary decision diagrams (BDDs), a multivalued dependency graph framework is developed and used to quantify the resilience of the system.

With trip records between November 2019 and September 2020 in Kunming, China, we identify people who relied on traveling by subway both before and after the first pandemic wave. We investigate whether and how travelers recover to their pre-pandemic mobility level. We find that public transport use recovered slowly, as urban mobility is a result of urban functionality, transport supply, social context, and inter-personal differences. In general, urban mobility represents a strengthened revisiting tendency during COVID-19, as individual’s trips occur within a more limited space. We confirm that travel behavior resilience differs by groups. Commuters recover travel frequency and length, while older people decrease frequency but retain activity space. The study suggests that policymakers take group heterogeneity and travel behavior resilience into account for transport management and city restoration.","2022-06-29","2024-12-01 14:05:27","2024-12-01 14:05:28","2024-12-01 14:05:27","18","","1","2","","npj Urban Sustain","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\DT7XG8AV\Wang et al. - 2022 - Resilience and recovery of public transport use du.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diffusion Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network and a dynamic-capturing algorithm of transportation resilience jointly form the backbone of this framework. The presented framework can capture the spatiotemporal dependencies of urban road network and evaluate transportation resilience based on real-world big data, including on-demand ride services data provided by DiDi Chuxing and grid meteorological data. Results show that aggregate data of related precipitation events could be used for transportation resilience modeling under extreme weather events when facing sample imbalance problem due to limited historical disaster data. In terms of observed transportation resilience, transportation network demonstrates different characteristics between sparse network and dense network, as well as general precipitation events and extreme weather events. The response time is double or triple of the recovery time, and an elastic limit exists in the recovery process of network resilience. In terms of resilience prediction, the proposed model outperforms competitors by incorporating topological information and has better predictions of the system performance degradation than other resilience indices.

The decision of where to add new links is made to generate as many origin–destination (O-D) pairs with alternative distinct routes as possible to potentially alleviate the impact of disruptions. Mathematically, we formulate the problem as a binary integer bi-level program (BLP), where the upper-level subprogram maximizes the total number of O-D pairs with alternative distinct routes subject to a budgetary constraint, and the lower-level subprogram counts the maximum number of distinct routes be­ tween each O-D pair under a given design scheme. Computationally, the BLP model can be equivalently reformulated as a single-level mixed-integer linear program (MILP) by using the equivalent continuous relaxation and optimality conditions of the lower-level subprogram and linearization techniques for the complementarity conditions. The globally optimum solution of the MILP structure of the reformulated model can be obtained using existing algorithms in commercial software packages. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the validity, features, and flexibility of the proposed route diversity-oriented network design model in terms of optimizing the network redundancy. The proposed route diversity redundant network design contributes toward enhancing network resilience against disruptions in the pre-disaster stage of transportation network planning and assists in redundancy-oriented time-dependent network growth. It can also serve as an upper-bound solution for the long-term network design problem when travelers’ route choice behaviors and travel demands are considered in the design process.","2021-10","2024-12-01 14:05:41","2024-12-01 14:05:41","2024-12-01 14:05:41","102448","","","154","","Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\IB5IJ67W\Xu et al. - 2021 - Enhancing network resilience by adding redundancy .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is imperative to engineer resilient public transportation systems to provide urban commuters with a reliable alternative to private vehicles. Current network-based approaches for resilience quantification focused on the network topology but seldom considered the impacts of temporal variation of flow pattern and system’s spatial distribution, which provide unique people-centric insights into resilience. This paper applies a resilience cycle framework consisting of four life-cycle stages associated with any disruptive event – preparedness, robustness, recoverability, and adaptation. The proposed flow-weighted and spatial analysis captures the resilience of both the system and users. Additionally, the temporal trends are compared for different resilience indicators associated with the topology and flow patterns. A case study of the Hong Kong metro system shows the utility of the framework. The study found that the average travel distance of flows has a strong negative effect on the network’s robustness to random failures. The vulnerability of the network to random failures can also be explained by the node homogeneity results from the preparedness stage. In the recovery stage, densely-built metro stations are found to provide significant benefit in response to disruptions, provided that the shared risks for the nearby stations are minimal.

The results show that the resilience of road passenger and freight transport differs in the face of external disturbance. Freight transport resilience is better than that of passenger transport. Compared to passenger transport, freight transport is more robust; the impacted speed is slower, the recovery speed is faster, the recovery capacity is stronger, and the affected period is shorter. There is regional heterogeneity in road transport resilience. This heterogeneity is reﬂected in the whole change process of system performance with external disturbance, including absorption capacity, adaptation capacity, and recovery capacity. The resilience of road transport under different waves of the epidemic is different.

The formulation of this resilience-based performance metric (referred in the paper as WIPW), systematically integrates the network topology, redundancy level, trafﬁc patterns, structural reliability of network components (i.e. roads and bridge) and functionality of the network during community’s post-disaster recovery, and permits risk mitigation alternatives for improving transportation network resilience to be compared on a common basis. Using the WIPW as a network performance metric, we propose a project ranking mechanism for identifying and prioritizing transportation network retroﬁt projects that are critical for effective pre-disaster risk mitigation and resilience planning. We further present a decision methodology to select optimal solutions among possible alternatives of new construction, which offer opportunities to improve the resilience of the network by altering its existing topology.

This paper investigates the role of network topology, and the topology’s characteristics, in a transportation system’s ability to cope with disaster. Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that the topological attributes of a transportation system significantly affect its resilience to disaster events. Resilience accounts for not only the innate ability of the system to absorb externally induced changes, but also cost-effective and efficient, adaptive actions that can be taken to preserve or restore performance post-event. Comprehensive and systematically designed numerical experiments were conducted on 17 network structures with some relation to transportation system layout. Resilience of these network structures in terms of throughput, connectivity or compactness was quantified. Resilience is considered with and without the benefits of preparedness and recovery actions. The impact of component-level damage on system resilience is also investigated. A comprehensive, systematic analysis of results from these experiments provides a basis for the characterization of highly resilient network topologies and conversely identification of network attributes that might lead to poorly performing systems.","2015-06","2024-12-01 14:06:12","2024-12-01 14:06:12","2024-12-01 14:06:12","35-45","","","46","","Journal of Transport Geography","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\MHCWD3XA\Zhang et al. - 2015 - Assessing the role of network topology in transpor.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research has substantially advanced the knowledge on general human mobility patterns in cities, primarily about the spatiotemporal characteristics of trajectories of urban population, but has rarely examined the perturbation of these mobility patterns during EWEs. To quantitatively assess human mobility perturbation, this study proposes to measure both the instantaneous perturbation at any given moment during an EWE, and the accumulated perturbation over the entire timespan of the EWE. Using two metrics that are developed for the above purpose, a case study is conducted in Nanjing, a major city in China, which recently experienced record-breaking rainstorm and snowstorm events. Based on trajectories of all taxies and buses in Nanjing during these events, the case study quantitatively assesses the perturbation of human mobility in the city, compares it between two EWEs and between two modes of transport, and analyzes the geographical distribution of the perturbation within the city boundary.

However, using the transport metric for resilience improvement can only provide a limited view of transport pre-investments. This study develops an optimization framework to tackle the problem of resilient road pre-investment with the aim of resilience enhancement of traffic systems from an economic perspective by applying the integrated computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. First, we use the Shapley value, which considers road links’ interact cooperation, to determine critical candidate links that need to be upgraded. Second, we propose the Economic-based Network Resilience Measure (ENRM) as a per­ formance indicator to evaluate network-level resilience from the economic perspective. Third, a bi-level multiobjective optimization model is formulated to identify the optimal capacity improvement for candidate critical links, where the objectives of the upper-level model are to minimize the ENRM and pre-enhancement budget. The lower-level model is built on the integrated CGE model. The genetic algorithm approach is used to solve the proposed bi-level model. A case study of the optimization framework is presented using a simplified Sydney network. Results suggest that a higher budget can help promote people’s social welfare and improve trans­ portation resilience. However, the Pareto-optimality is observed, and the marginal utility decreases with an increase in the investment budget. Further, the results also show that investment returns are higher in severe disasters. This study will help transport planners and practitioners optimize resilience pre-event investment strategies by capturing a wider range of project impacts and evaluating their economic impacts under general equilibrium rather than partial economic equilibrium, which is often assumed in traditional four-step transport planning.","2023","2024-12-01 14:06:23","2024-12-01 14:06:23","2024-12-01 14:06:23","100027","","","3","","Sustainability Analytics and Modeling","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\58P32A7Y\Zhang et al. - 2023 - Transportation resilience optimization from an eco.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The uncertainty created by COVID-19 makes it is difficult for various industries to deal with the pandemic. Since the pandemic, the supply chain’s resilience has been discussed and examined in some studies. However, most existing works start from a single industry perspective or pay more attention to the disturbance caused by changes in the production side. Supply chain networks of different in­ dustries, mainly transport networks, are relatively limited under the epidemic’s impact. In this paper, from the perspective of highway freight transport, a comprehensive competitiveness evaluation framework was proposed to reveal and the disruption and resilience of the supply chain under the outbreak based on nine indexes with five dimensions, including efficiency, capacity, activity, connectivity, and negotiability. Based on the availability of the data(Large-scale truck trajectory), we sorted out seven categories of Chinese industries(related to highway transport) and divided them into four categories respectively: (a) Slight disruption and worse resilience; (b) Slight disruption and remarkable resilience; (c) Serious disruption and worse resilience; (d) Serious disruption and remarkable resilience. The measurement results of supply chain network performance show that the in­ dustries (cold-chain, general products, and other industries) dominated by “Efficiency - Negotiability - Con­ nectivity” are slightly disrupted (about 33%), forming a spatial diffusion with Wuhan(the city where the pandemic first broke out) as the disrupted center, spreading outward in a circle structure. Simultaneously, five urban agglomerations surrounding it have been impacted. By contrast, due to the strict isolation measures, the industries (building materials, construction, engineering, and high-value products industry) more vulnerable to be disrupted seriously (about 82%) tend to be the pattern of “Capacity - Activity”. However, a large-scale centralized disruption was observed in the Triangle of Central China urban agglomeration was presented, resulting in almost stagnation of industry development. Meanwhile, as the future of the pandemic remains un­ certain, the supply chain represented by the engineering industry, construction industry, etc are deserved to be paid more attention in line with they are prone to large-scale centralized damage due to the disruption of a single city node.","2022-03","2024-12-01 14:07:11","2024-12-01 14:07:12","2024-12-01 14:07:11","165-178","","","118","","Transport Policy","Will multi-industry supply chains' resilience under the impact of COVID-19 pandemic be different?","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\4X76GQSC\Fu et al. - 2022 - Will multi-industry supply chains' resilience unde.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The geographical traits of the multi-layer CAN was first explored and, taking the Daxing International Airport (a new-built airport in Beijing, China) as a demonstrative example, we then conducted both qualitative and quantitative analyses to investigate the impact of the proposed strategies and their effectiveness of improving network resilience. It is revealed that those strategies have heterogeneous effects on the network performance in terms of meeting passenger demands and balancing overall connectivity at a national strategic level, and the overall resilience of the CAN could be significantly improved under the selected strategy by 59.8% on average.

The COVID-19 pandemic induced environment presents a divide between the “new and old normal” with policy and planning implications for health, transport and general socio-economic growth and development. Multiple and complex nuanced transport matters cascade all geographic scales and pervade all sectors of the economy. The extent to which existing transport systems capacities are resilient, adaptive, and optimized for complete disaster planning, management and sustainability is questioned. This paper critically reviews how the COVID-19 pandemic has stretched the resilience and adaptive transport systems capacities in South Africa. A critical question interrogated is whether on-going policy and planning interventions constitute imperfect or perfect attempts at closing COVID -19 policy and planning emergent gaps. The paper makes use of South Africa as a case study, referencing the Disaster Management Act (No. 57 of 2002) and logical Disaster Management Act: Regulations relating to COVID-19 (Government Notice 318 of 2020),1 with specific reference to the transport sector lockdown regulations in unravelling policy and planning implications.

This is considered one aspect of resiliency for transportation systems. Although unmet demand has been proposed as one measure of resilience for freight transportation, it has rarely been used for general transportation systems. This study takes unmet demand and total travel time as two measures in modeling the restoration plan problem and proposes a bi-objective bi-level optimization framework to determine an optimal transportation infrastructure restoration plan. The lower-level problem uses Elastic User Equilibrium to model the imbalance between demand and supply and measures the unmet demand for a given transportation network. The upper-level problem, formulated as bi-objective mathematical programming, determines optimal resource allocation for roadway restoration. The bi-level problems are solved by a modified active set algorithm and a network representation method derived from Network Design Problems. The Weighted Sum Method is adopted to solve the Pareto Frontier of this bi-objective optimization problem. The proposed restoration plan optimization method was applied to a typical road network in Sioux Falls, to verify the effectiveness of the methodology. For a given failure scenario, the Pareto Frontier of this bi-objective bi-level optimization problem with various budget levels, cross-referring to the travel efficiency of each solution, was illustrated to demonstrate how the proposed method can support decision-making for road network restoration. To further study the performance of the proposed method, different scenarios were generated with one to five links disrupted and the proposed methodology was applied with different budget levels. The statistical analysis of the optimized solutions for these scenarios demonstrates that a higher budget could help reduce unmet demand in the system by providing more restoration options.","2020-08","2024-12-01 14:07:39","2024-12-01 14:07:40","2024-12-01 14:07:39","102700","","","117","","Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\4EJEFTAP\Zhao and Zhang - 2020 - Transportation infrastructure restoration optimiza.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By using a combined method of hydrological ﬂood modeling and GIS analysis, this paper demonstrates the increasing vulnerability of the transport system in Ho Chi Minh City based on current plans for transport development. The paper highlights the need to consider a new approach to transport planning and advocates the application of a Resilient Transport System (RTS) which can be integrated into potential revisions of city master plans to help Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) shift from resistance to resilience to extreme ﬂoods. The focal point of the concept is the spatial transfer of transport ﬂows based on a pre-organised structural and ﬂexible transport system constituted by links, nodes and relevant services in terms of diﬀerent levels of elevation and locations. The intrinsic value of its application to the transport plan is that a city can retain a certain capacity (probably on a smaller scale) of its transport system in order to mitigate potential impacts on urban activities resulting from ﬂood disruptions.","2019-04","2024-12-01 14:07:54","2024-12-01 14:07:54","2024-12-01 14:07:54","28-43","","","15","","Travel Behaviour and Society","Resilient transport systems to reduce urban vulnerability to floods in emerging-coastal cities","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\WZAYBDJ2\Duy et al. - 2019 - Resilient transport systems to reduce urban vulner.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, measures to improve practical resilience have not been addressed and elucidated. Various studies from the domains of disaster and transport have been devoted to commuting vulnerability analysis and transport network robustness assessment, whereas a systematic perspective is rarely used to analyze the damage mecha­ nism of floods to the commuting system. To fill this research gap, we constructed an index system from the dimensions of hazard, transport network condition, and commuting pattern as driving factors of commuting risk during floods. The contribution to commuting loss was first assessed to guide intervention prioritization based on flood modeling and commute simulation. We adopted gradient boosting decision trees to examine the rela­ tionship between driving factors from three dimensions and commuting. The results of this study conducted in Wuhan indicate that the contribution rate of commuting pattern is the highest, followed by hazard, and finally road network conditions. The effective thresholds of the driving factors were also identified to guide urban governance.

The Coledale Beck catchment in northwest England was subject to an extreme rainfall event in December 2015 that equated to a 1 in 200-year event. The catchment contains the UK's ﬁrst passive metal mine water treatment system, and as such had been subject to intense monitoring of solute dynamics before and after commissioning. Due to this monitoring record, the site provides a unique opportunity to assess the effects of a major storm event on (1) catchment-scale solute transport, and (2) the resilience of the new and novel passive treatment system to extreme events. Monitoring suggests a modest decline in treatment efﬁciency over time that is not synchronous with the storm event and explained instead by changes in system hydraulic efﬁciency. There was no apparent ﬂushing of the mine system during the event that could potentially have compromised treatment system performance. Analysis of metal transport in the catchment downstream of the mine suggests relatively subtle changes in instream chemistry with modest but statistically-signiﬁcant reductions in zinc in the lower catchment irrespective of ﬂow condition after the extreme event, but most parameters of interest show no signiﬁcant change. Increased export of colloidal iron and aluminium is associated with major landslips in the mid-catchment after the storm and provide fresh sorption sites to attenuate dissolved zinc more rapidly in these locations, corroborated by laboratory experiments utilising site materials to investigate the attenuation/release of metals from stream and terrestrial sediments. The data are important as they show both the resilience of passive mine water treatment systems to extreme events and the importance of catchment-scale monitoring to ensure continued effectiveness of treatment initiatives after major perturbation.","2021-01","2024-12-01 14:08:41","2024-12-01 14:08:42","2024-12-01 14:08:41","141693","","","750","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\TFNFK3C4\Mayes et al. - 2021 - Effect of an extreme flood event on solute transpo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accordingly, an agent-based modelling (ABM) framework is developed to enable the nuanced examination on resilience of earthquake-damaged RNs, when different system repair approaches are considered. In this framework, those different approaches are predicated on the damage level of individual bridges and on the system recovery timeline, i.e. the response to rehabilitation need is considered as a function of the time elapsed from the event. Each approach is represented by a different agent, whose behaviour is shaped by a set of pre-defined behavioural attributes, while the interplay among those agents is also accounted for, during the entirety of post-shock recovery campaigns. To demonstrate its applicability, the ABM framework is applied to a real-world RN across Luchon, France. As shown by the case-study, post-shock rapid responses are found to be a viable strategy to increase the recovery rate of RNs’ functionality in the im­ mediate-, and mid-term aftermath of damaging earthquakes, and ultimately, to improve the seismic resilience thereof.","2021-12","2024-12-01 14:08:46","2024-12-01 14:08:47","2024-12-01 14:08:46","108030","","","216","","Reliability Engineering & System Safety","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\XWPTC7LZ\Sun et al. - 2021 - Agent-based model on resilience-oriented rapid res.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The decision of where to add new links is made to generate as many origin–destination (O-D) pairs with alternative distinct routes as possible to potentially alleviate the impact of disruptions. Mathematically, we formulate the problem as a binary integer bi-level program (BLP), where the upper-level subprogram maximizes the total number of O-D pairs with alternative distinct routes subject to a budgetary constraint, and the lower-level subprogram counts the maximum number of distinct routes be­ tween each O-D pair under a given design scheme. Computationally, the BLP model can be equivalently reformulated as a single-level mixed-integer linear program (MILP) by using the equivalent continuous relaxation and optimality conditions of the lower-level subprogram and linearization techniques for the complementarity conditions. The globally optimum solution of the MILP structure of the reformulated model can be obtained using existing algorithms in commercial software packages. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the validity, features, and flexibility of the proposed route diversity-oriented network design model in terms of optimizing the network redundancy. The proposed route diversity redundant network design contributes toward enhancing network resilience against disruptions in the pre-disaster stage of transportation network planning and assists in redundancy-oriented time-dependent network growth. It can also serve as an upper-bound solution for the long-term network design problem when travelers’ route choice behaviors and travel demands are considered in the design process.","2021-10","2024-12-01 14:09:04","2024-12-01 14:09:04","2024-12-01 14:09:04","102448","","","154","","Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\5DU2SH53\Xu et al. - 2021 - Enhancing network resilience by adding redundancy .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is becoming urgent to study approaches to enhance power distribution system resilience. This paper presents a two-stage optimization method for improving resilience of power distribution systems. The two-stage method is influenced by a transportation network, which considers the interdependence between traffic roads and overhead distribution lines. In the first stage, based on the Bayesian network and the Monte Carlo method, the locations of emergency stations, e.g., charging stations and repair stations are pre-positioned to improve the recovery speed of interrupted loads after disasters. Then the second stage is to co-optimize the dispatch of mobile energy storage systems and repair crews on transportation network to minimize the shedding of critical loads while considering operation constraints of power, voltage and power flow for power distribution system. The dispatch of mobile energy storage systems and repair crews are affected by the locations of emergency stations in the first stage. The route of mobile energy storage systems and repair crews on transportation network can be obtained from the results in the second stage. The proposed method is tested on a modified IEEE 33-bus distribution test system with a corresponding transportation network.

This paper integrates component-based resilience quantification methods and SHM techniques to present a new probabilistic framework for seismic structural system evaluation and decision analysis. A trilateral framework is introduced which (1) uses the data obtained from a localized wireless sensor network to detect and locate damage, (2) develops component-based functionality curves to quantify the seismic resilience of the structure, and (3) makes post-quake rapid decisions based on a multicriteria safety evaluation method. A nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (ARX) model is used to identify structural response and a statistical damage-sensitive coefficient is used to detect, locate, and measure damage in the system. Minor damages due to corrosion and major damages due to past extreme events are studied in the functionality analysis.

While most studies focused on the assessment and quantification of community resilience, there is a lack of research on how to incorporate the probabilistic seismic performance, which is obtained from performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE), of individual buildings into the assessment. This manuscript presents a framework to bridge the gap between seismic performance of buildings and community resilience. In addition, a novel long-term resilience indicator integrating the probability of earthquakes with different magnitudes is proposed. The framework can be used to assess if the desired community resilience goals can be achieved by evaluating the seismic performance of buildings and other infrastructure systems. To explicitly account for the interdependence of different infra­ structure systems during the restoration process, a network-based recovery model is established. The framework is illustratively applied to a community consisting of buildings, power distribution system, and transportation system by performing a large number of post-earthquake recovery simulations. The simulation results demon­ strate that the framework is effective to link the proposed long-term resilience indicator to the seismic perfor­ mance of individual buildings and it highlights the importance of considering the interdependence between infrastructure systems in community resilience assessment.","2021-08","2024-12-01 14:09:41","2024-12-01 14:09:42","2024-12-01 14:09:41","106788","","","147","","Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\KXMATXFW\You et al. - 2021 - A framework to link community long-term resilience.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the overall perspective, we propose a cooperative coverage model. On one hand, it helps network operators improve the recovery speed of the entire multimodal transport network in the event of a disaster. On the other hand, it maximizes the effect of the rescue cost of government managers. But we must note that in most transport networks, failure data is difficult to be collected or is insufficient. Therefore, we propose the premise that the network failure may occur at any point. The rescue demand is quantified by the links/nodes importance, which is calculated by the multi-attribute decision-making method based on hesitant intuitionistic fuzzy set-technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS). Then, a multi-objective non-linear programming model is established, and fast non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-cellular automata (NSGA-II-CA) is designed to solve the model. Taking the multimodal transport network in the Sichuan-Tibet region of China as an example, calculation and analysis are performed to verify the effectiveness and advancement of the proposed model and algorithm.

This comprehensive approach aims to thoroughly evaluate the resilience of the LSN. The study’s results reveal noteworthy variations in the cascading effects across diverse load distribution distances and transportation times. Furthermore, it delves into load distribution strategies to improve the resilience of the LSN and investigates the impact of capacity parameters on cascading effects. The results indicate that the distribution strategy proposed in this paper, integrating transportation time and redundancy levels, effectively suppresses the spread of cascading faults and improves network resilience.

To address the abovementioned limitations, we have proposed a performance indicator called the demand–impedance (DI) indicator, in which demand and impedance are reflected by passenger trips and travel time. By considering effective travel paths (ETPs) and passengers’ path choice behavior, we have proposed a node centrality called effective path betweenness (EPB) by modifying the betweenness centrality (BC) to evaluate the importance of stations. The performance curve of a URT network during the attack and repair processes is depicted using the DI indicator, and a modified resilience metric is formulated by referring to the resilience triangle. The model application in the Chengdu subway network demonstrates that the correlation coefficient between the EPB and BC of stations is 0.901, which indicates that stations with a higher EPB are inclined to have a higher BC. The Chengdu subway network demonstrates a higher resilience under random disturbances than it does under malicious disturbances. Disturbance duration, passengers’ tolerance time, and rescue ability on the Chengdu subway network significantly affect its resilience. Several practical suggestions involving the management of disturbances, shortening the emergency response time, providing passenger services, and improving emergency rescue ability are provided for managing the Chengdu subway system under disturbances.","2022-01","2024-12-01 14:10:00","2024-12-01 14:10:01","2024-12-01 14:10:00","126517","","","586","","Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","Resilience assessment of an urban rail transit network","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\IUXVGGRH\Chen et al. - 2022 - Resilience assessment of an urban rail transit net.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the complex network theory, this study took the Beijing Subway system (BSS) as an example to assess the robustness of a subway network in face of random failures (RFs) as well as malicious attacks (MAs). Speciﬁcally, (1) the topological properties of the rail transit system were quantitatively analyzed by means of a mathematical statistical model; (2) a new weighted composite index was developed and proved to be valid for evaluation of node importance, which could be utilized to position hub stations in a subway network; (3) a simulation analysis was conducted to examine the variations in the network performance as well as the dynamic characteristics of system response in face of different disruptions. The results reveal that the BSS exhibits typical characteristics of a scale-free network, with relatively high survivability and robustness when faced with RFs, whereas error tolerance is relatively low when the hubs undergo MAs. In addition, illustrations of dynamic variations in the inﬂuence of the BSS under a series of MAs were provided by spatial analysis techniques of Geographical Information System (GIS), which directly veriﬁed the earlier conclusions.

However, recent events show that not all perturbation events can be foreseen. The concept of resilience has been introduced to measure not only the system's ability to absorb perturbations, but also its ability to rapidly recover from perturbations. In this work, we propose a simulation-based model for quantifying resilience in mass railway transportation systems by quantifying passenger delay and passenger load as the system's performance indicators. We integrate all subsystems that make up mass railway transportation systems (transportation, power, telecommunication and organisation subsystems) and their interdependencies. The model is applied to the Paris mass railway transportation system. The model's results show that since trains continue running within the system even by decreasing their speed, the system remains resilient. During the normal operation of the system as well as during perturbation, the model shows similarities with reality. The perturbation management plan that consists of setting up temporary train services on part of the impacted line while repairing the failed system's component is considered in this work. We also assess the extent to which some resilient system's capacities (i.e. absorption, adaptation and recovery) can increase the resilience of the system.","2016-09","2024-12-01 14:10:31","2024-12-01 14:10:31","2024-12-01 14:10:30","1-14","","","153","","Reliability Engineering & System Safety","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\54IEZR97\Adjetey-Bahun et al. - 2016 - A model to quantify the resilience of mass railway.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To assess the resilience of a transportation network, however, it is essential to model its interactions with and reliance on other lifelines. Prior works might consider these interactions implicitly, perhaps in the form of hazard impact scenarios wherein services from a second lifeline (e.g. power) are precluded due to a hazard event. In this paper, a bi-level, mixed-integer, stochastic program is presented for quantifying the resilience of a coupled traffic-power network under a host of potential natural or anthropogenic hazard-impact scenarios. A two-layer network representation is employed that includes details of both systems. Interdependencies between the urban traffic and electric power distribution systems are captured through linking variables and logical constraints. The modeling approach was applied on a case study developed on a portion of the signalized traffic-power distribution system in southern Minneapolis. The results of the case study show the importance of explicitly considering interdependencies between critical infrastructures in transportation resilience estimation. The results also provide insights on lifeline performance from an alternate power perspective.","2017-07","2024-12-01 14:10:34","2024-12-01 14:10:35","2024-12-01 14:10:34","79-94","","","163","","Reliability Engineering & System Safety","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\ESR929H2\Fotouhi et al. - 2017 - Quantifying the resilience of an urban traffic-ele.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The framework considers dependencies pertaining to failure propagation, system-of-systems architecture and resources required for operating and repairing assets. Stochastic asset failure is captured by a scenario tree generation algorithm whereas the redistribution of network flows and the optimal deployment of repair resources are modelled using a minimum cost flow approach.

Considering a transit network as a socio-technical system induces coupling with other technical systems, such as communication networks and other transportation modes, which support user adaptability in disruption. Extending concepts from fault trees and binary decision diagrams (BDDs), a multivalued dependency graph framework is developed and used to quantify the resilience of the system.

However, modelling and assessment of cyber-physical resilience are not easy for the com­ plicated interaction between 4I(municipal Infrastructure, human Individuality, vehicle Instrument and network Information). In this paper, a Causal Bayesian Network (CBN) framework is employed for resilience modelling and assessment, which is described by absorptive, adaptive and restorative capacity. Forward propagation, backward propagation and sensitivity analysis are being conducted. For validation, a case study via real-world Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) data is utilized to analyze the system’s self-healing process. In the un­ derlying CBN model, absorptive capacity is 74.56%, which exhibits a good fit with RFID data analysis that performs a 75% performance index compared with the original state in heavy rainfall scenario.

Resilience, here, pertains to a CI’s ability to adapt or rapidly recover from disruptive events. In this paper, the problem of optimizing and managing the resilience of CIs is studied. In particular, a comprehensive two-fold framework is proposed to improve CI resilience by considering both the individual CIs and their collective contribution to an entire system of multiple CIs. To this end, a novel analytical resilience index is proposed to measure the effect of each CI’s physical components on its probability of failure. In particular, a Markov chain defining each CI’s performance state and a Bayesian network modeling the probability of failure are introduced to infer each CI’s resilience index. Then, to maximize the resilience of a system of CIs, a novel approach for allocating resources, such as drones or maintenance personnel, is proposed. In particular, a comprehensive resource allocation framework, based on the tools of contract theory, is proposed enabling the system operator to optimally allocate resources, such as, redundant components or monitoring devices to each individual CI based on its economic contribution to the entire system. The optimal solution of the contract-based resilience resource allocation problem is analytically derived using dynamic programming. The proposed framework is then evaluated using a case study pertaining to hydropower dams and their interdependence to the power grid. Simulation results, within the case study, show that the system operator can economically benefit from allocating the resources while dams have a 60% average improvement over their initial resilience indices.","2021-01","2024-12-01 14:11:16","2024-12-01 14:11:16","2024-12-01 14:11:16","107243","","","205","","Reliability Engineering & System Safety","Resilient critical infrastructure","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\XY7PLIKU\Eldosouky et al. - 2021 - Resilient critical infrastructure Bayesian networ.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, the constraints of bridge functionality change with time, and the number of engineering teams are considered. To illustrate the proposed optimization model, a multi-objective non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is used to solve the restoration schedule optimization problem for a rural r-bTN with 45 nodes, 74 roads, and 15 bridges subjected to seismic events.

Subsequently, the risk module evaluates the initial post-earthquake state of the community by estimating the response and damage of various structures and infrastructure components, volume of debris, casualties, and immediate fatalities. The agent-based module simulates emergency response operations comprising search and rescue, injury transport and treatment, hospital functionality restoration, and road debris removal. This module also quantifies the time-variant demand and capacity of the network and emergency medical services. A computationally efficient network model simulates the time-variant network congestions, which is then used to compute the travel time of ambulances and ensuing additional fatalities.

To develop the resilience assessment model, we provide a comprehensive, dynamic index that considers passenger demand and infra­ structure supply. Three transportation modes are considered: bus, subway and taxi, and a cascading failure model is simulated. Data from Singapore are collected to analyse resilience indicators’ characteristics and explore relationship between resilience indicators and node measures. The results indicate that 1) when stations experience failure, it has the greatest impact on the accessibility of the transportation network, followed by efficiency and connectivity; 2) system resilience is negatively related to the node degree and node betweenness centrality of the attacked station; 3) beyond a certain threshold, continuing to increase stations’ additional ca­ pacity does not significantly increase system resilience. The proposed resilience index can be used as an opti­ mization goal during system design and recovery. The conclusions and recommendations can inform the management and improvement of urban transportation system resilience.","2023-10","2024-12-01 14:12:01","2024-12-01 14:12:02","2024-12-01 14:12:01","109478","","","238","","Reliability Engineering & System Safety","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\D8I79XCJ\Wang et al. - 2023 - A novel method to assess urban multimodal transpor.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although current studies have analyzed transportation resilience from different perspectives, accurately assessing the resilience of urban transport systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a framework to evaluate the static and dynamic resilience of urban transportation systems. Based on systemic thinking and sustainability perspectives, we establish a Bayesian network model that comprehensively considers social, economic, organizational, and technological dimensions to assess the static resilience of urban transportation systems. We adopt percolation theory to determine the minimum required performance (MRP) of road network and explore the spatial distri­ bution of dynamic resilience based on traffic performance under traffic congestion. Results show that the transportation resilience of Xi’an showed a continuous growth trend between 2010 and 2020, from 0.37 to 0.64. In addition, the primary task of enhancing resilience is to improve the system’s restorative capacity, adaptive capacity, and resourcefulness. The MRP of the road network is 0.37. The areas with larger resilience loss and percolation time are concentrated along the Second and Third Ring Expressway and in the south and southwest areas. The resilience of the urban center area is more potent. The time of the response process is twice that of the recovery process.

However, there is a lack of systematic research on the assessment of subsidy distribution with the consideration of shipping resilience and emission reduction. Disordered competition hinders the development of the multimodal transport market and also deters the achievement of carbon neutrality. To address these issues, this study proposes an optimized subsidy strategy with a bi-level subsidy decision-making model considering the pricing game between various carriers. Specifically, the amount of government subsidies is substituted into the upper model, and the carrier’s pricing decision is obtained by solving the Nash equilibrium of the tripartite pricing game. An activitybased approach is used to calculate the emission reduction corresponding to the subsidy amount. The variance of the transport time is used to measure the resilience of transportation. Finally, the optimal subsidy strategy is obtained through quantitative comparison. This study employs the multimodal transport of containers based on Shanghai Yangshan Port as a case study. The sensitivity analysis discloses that the time value of goods and freight market conditions should raise more attention in the process of subsidy policy formulation. Moreover, the waterway carrier should try to improve resilience and reduce the risk of delay. This study innovatively considers the pricing game between highway, railway, and waterway carriers and provides a rational basis for the formulation of subsidy policies in multimodal transport through quantitative analysis.","2023-09","2024-12-01 14:12:32","2024-12-01 14:12:33","2024-12-01 14:12:32","106760","","","243","","Ocean & Coastal Management","Subsidy policy optimization of multimodal transport on emission reduction considering carrier pricing game and shipping resilience","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\25VX6YMK\Chen et al. - 2023 - Subsidy policy optimization of multimodal transpor.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, such resilience investment made by one country to deal with such unconventional disruption risk is very hard to be verified by other countries (i.e., non-verifiability). This paper establishes an integrated economic model to analytically examine countries’ joint resilience investments on the cross-country transport infrastructure in presence of non-verifiability. Specifically, there is one “investing country” who constructed the infrastructure which is also used by a “host country”. Our analytical results suggest that the first-best investment and market outcomes for the global welfare maximization can be achieved if the resilience in­ vestment is verifiable. The non-verifiability is, however, found to cause a downward distortion in the resilience investment and an upward distortion in transport price when the probability of the disruption is higher such that the resilience investment only partially covers the potential loss. On the contrary, when the probability of disruption is low so that the resilience investment can lead to the full loss coverage, the first-best outcomes can still be achieved without any distortion. Our analytical model is also extended to account for the intermodal competition. Although our main conclusions still qualitatively hold, the intermodal competition is found to have uncertain effects on the market outcomes, depending on the interaction between the resilience investment cost and the degree of the intermodal competition.","2022-12","2024-12-01 14:13:07","2024-12-01 14:13:07","2024-12-01 14:13:07","406-423","","","166","","Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\PH2I72K7\Zheng et al. - 2022 - Joint investment on resilience of cross-country tr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A literature study is conducted to review the current status of research on transportation systems and Digital Twins. It is found that the current research on Digital Twins technology has achieved different degrees of success in different aspects of transportation sys­ tems. Yet, the system performance of Digital Twins has to be optimized. First, the application of Digital Twins in intelligent transportation systems is analyzed. Then, how the changes in traveler behavior patterns reflect the extent to which the traffic network is affected by uncertain events is analyzed from the traveler’s perspective. Finally, an Internet of Vehicles (IoV) system based on Digital Twins and blockchain is established to solve the data redundancy and high computational volume problems of in-vehicle data sharing common in the IoV system. Moreover, the perfor­ mance of the twin system is optimized by proposing a multi-intelligence body algorithm based on local perception, and a case validation is performed. The results demonstrate that the adaptability of the transportation system to uncertain events and its response and recovery measures taken are reflected to some extent in the traveler behavior model. Besides, data sharing between vehicles and infrastructure in the transportation network can be well solved by Digital Twins Blockchain. The locally-aware multi-intelligent body algorithm saves more than 50% communication over­ head and improves operational efficiency by nearly 20% over traditional algorithms by increasing intelligent body infrastructure units. It is adequately suited for large-scale vehicle traffic twins. It can be seen that improving the resilience of Digital Twins is a very obvious change in the adaptability of the traffic system.","2023-07","2024-12-01 14:13:17","2024-12-01 14:13:18","2024-12-01 14:13:17","103686","","","173","","Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\AYNFIG9T\Feng et al. - 2023 - Resilience towarded Digital Twins to improve the a.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This model contains three parts: (1) a traffic flow simulation model to get flow distributed throughout the whole network, (2) different real-world disruptions are abstracted as random, localized, and flood disturbances, (3) functional and topological resilience are accessed by analyzing variations in travel time and connected components before and after a disruption occurs. 40 major cities are chosen to conduct resilience assessments. As the intensity of the disruption increases, common trends in the changes of functional and topological resilience values are observed and analyzed across all studied cities. In most cases, flood disruption is the least disruptive one of all three types of disruptions. Regression models are developed to estimate functional and topological resilience after random, localized, and flood disturbances. Possible resilience enhancement strategies are discussed based on ana­ lyses of regression models. This study could aid stakeholders in gaining a clear understanding of resilience not only topologically but also from the perspective of traffic flow and offer them practical strategies to enhance resilience in face of disruptions.","2023-07","2024-12-01 14:13:22","2024-12-01 14:13:23","2024-12-01 14:13:22","103687","","","173","","Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice","An integrated resilience assessment model of urban transportation network","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\4AG8EHVY\Yin et al. - 2023 - An integrated resilience assessment model of urban.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is no clear definition of customer-oriented maritime supply chain resilience (MSCR) during pandemic. This study proposes a definition of MSCR in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the needs of customers (i.e., freight service continuity and freight rate stability). The study aims to investigate the hierarchical and causal relationships among MSCR enablers and classify them into driving and dependence power, using an integrated multi-criteria decisionmaking (MCDM) approach that combines Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM), fuzzy Matriced Impacts Crois´es Multiplication Appliqu´ee a´ un Classement (MICMAC), and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL). A total of eighteen MSCR enablers during the pandemic are identified through literature review and experts’ opinions. The results of the study manifest that the most influential enabler is the redundancy plan, while freight service continuity and freight rate stability are determined to be the most significant and resultant enablers.

The Bayesian persuasion framework is used to model the government’s design on its information signaling mechanism. We also solve the equilibrium outcomes of gov­ ernment subsidy policy and benchmark them with those under the persuasion strategy. Our analytical results suggest that the government’s optimal persuasion strategy depends on the common prior belief on the disaster and the expected level of unavoidable loss (NL). When the NL is low (or intermediate, respectively), the persuasion strategy should be full (or partial, respec­ tively) disclosure of the government’s information to the facility operator. When the NL is high, the persuasion strategy has no impacts. In terms of social welfare improvement, the persuasion strategy dominates (or is dominated by, respectively) the subsidy policy if the effectiveness of the adaptation investment is low (or high, respectively). When the effectiveness of the adaptation investment is intermediate, the comparison is uncertain. Furthermore, we extend our model to the oligopoly case with multiple competing transport facilities and also allow their adaptation in­ vestments to have positive externality.

This paper presents a method for investigating how the ATN responds to the COVID-19 pandemic from its outbreak through deterioration, adaptation, and restoration. The concept of system state is introduced to investigate when the ATN has substantially changed. By comparing the structure of the temporal ATN in different weeks based on network similarity assessment, the changing points of the ATN are detected, where the network system has switched from one state to another. To quantify what are the changes to the ATN’s structure, several performance metrics, including global and local connectivity, are evaluated around the changing points. Moreover, to study the response time of the ATN to the pandemic, the time lag between the changing points of the ATN and that of the confirmed cases is examined. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the ATNs of Mainland China and the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in some interesting findings and policy implications. It is found that in a pandemic outbreak, China is more likely to suspend routes directly, while the U.S. is reducing flight fre­ quency to maintain essential airport connections. Further, the state transition of ATNs caused by policies is temporary, while the state change caused by the pandemic is permanent.","2023-11","2024-12-01 14:13:41","2024-12-01 14:13:41","2024-12-01 14:13:41","103836","","","177","","Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice","How air transport networks respond to long-lasting disruptive events like COVID-19","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\LSKPIJYW\Li et al. - 2023 - How air transport networks respond to long-lasting.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing studies have been conducted to analyze interdependent network resilience addressing unidirectional dependency, which triggers and propagates network failures. The loss and recovery of network functionality are complicated and important under such interdependency. Ignoring the interdependency nature of different networks would lead to incomplete or incorrect results in their resilience assessment. This paper developed a resilience assessment model for interdepen­ dent transit networks under failures. Taking the interdependency relations, network topology, flow characteristics, and demand distribution into account, the proposed methodology explicitly quantifies the impacts of varying network interdependency on the resilience of interdependent networks. The approach was applied to the interdependent metro and bus networks of Xi’an, China. Results show the resilience of interdependent networks is greatly affected by node degree heterogeneity in topology. The higher the heterogeneity of interdependent nodes, the larger the network resilience becomes. The bidirectional function dependency among networks demon­ strates dominant effects on the resilience of interdependent networks if one network is disrupted. If interdependent networks have homogeneous function, the resilience of the networks would be significantly improved with the increase in interdependency. The degree of flow matching be­ tween both networks plays a particularly important role in network resilience enhancement. Findings of this study would provide practical implications for the design and planning of interdependent infrastructure systems under disasters.","2024-01","2024-12-01 14:13:46","2024-12-01 14:13:46","2024-12-01 14:13:46","103907","","","179","","Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice","Modeling the resilience of interdependent networks","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\P8I4PZQR\Xu et al. - 2024 - Modeling the resilience of interdependent networks.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this purpose, a Random Forest-based model is developed, which is combined with techniques of explainable machine learning. The results reveal that during the pandemic, human perceptual factors, notably increased air pressure, humidity and temperature, play an important role in accident severity. This suggests that alleviating driver anxiety, caused by these factors, may be more effective in curbing crash severity than conventional road condition improvements. Further analysis shows that the pandemic leads notable shifts in residents’ daily travel time and accident-prone spatial segments, indicating the need for increased regulatory measures.

In this paper, we propose a resilience assessment framework based on performance-based measurement metrics. We develop a dynamic simulation procedure that considers the impacts of disruptions on passenger choices of path and departure time. By incorporating these features into the simulation procedure, we can effectively model the variations of passenger flow under disruptions. Finally, to demonstrate the proposed resilience assessment framework and dynamic simulation procedure, the multi-modal public transportation system in Beijing is considered as a case study. The results reveal that the system exhibits good resistance and recovery capabilities, but it lacks robustness.

To account for spatial dependence and interactions, a exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), a global spatial autoregressive model, and a local Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) are employed. Results show that, after controlling for other key aspects of resilience, such as industrial diversity and human capital, the global relationships between rail density, access to intermodal services, and access to local and regional markets were positively associated with regional performance (measured as competitive effect) during the recession. Similarly, positive regional performance before the recession period was associated with positive performance during the recession. The local spatial analysis, however, shows that the associations between the explanatory variables and regional performance vary significantly across space.

To overcome issues with data availability, four sample weeks were surveyed using online data sources, supplemented by secondary sources. Using the Cardiff Capital Region in Great Britain as an example, we show how the rail freight industry is particularly affected by disturbances in other sectors, due to the connecting role it plays, but also that some new growth paths have emerged. The number of trains operated decreased by 30% over the six year period, with significant declines in coal and automotive traffic following the closure of sources for freight. By contrast, intermodal has seen growth, due to wider economic conditions as well as policy disturbances. The study builds on existing rail freight research, the resilience perspective effectively highlighting that external disturbances affect demand over the long term.

The dynamic processes occurring at the node and link levels are often ignored. Here we analyze airport network resilience by considering both structural and dynamical aspects. We develop a simulation model to study the operational performance of the air transport system when airports operate at degraded capacity rather than completely shutting down. Our analyses show that the system deteriorates soon after disruptive events occur but returns to an acceptable level after a period of time. Static resilience of the airport network is captured by a phase transition in which a small change to airport capacity will result in a sharp change in system punctuality. After the phase transition point, decreasing airport capacity has little impact on system performance. Critical airports which have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the performance of whole system are identiﬁed, and we ﬁnd that some of these cannot be detected based on the analysis of network structural indicators alone.

Delivering, managing and maintaining transport assets that are resilient and adaptive to changing environmental conditions have become a priority for many governments worldwide. Central to ensuring that transport infrastructure functions at their optimum and is resilient to external changes is performance measurement, as it enables those processes that need to be modiﬁed and improved for enhancing the asset’s adaptability throughout their lifecycle to be identiﬁed. Despite the importance of performance measurement in ensuring the resilience of transport infrastructure, it has received limited attention by governments in their policy making. Therefore, this paper provides a review of the extant literature and proposes a life-cycle resilient performance measurement framework (PMF) within transport context.

The ensuing damages can result in enormous direct and indirect economic losses to the traffic network and consequently the individuals through conditions like inaccessibility to commuters and reduction in traffic safety. Many studies have claimed that a robust transportation system could significantly prevent such consequences from natural hazards such as floods, highlighting the importance of robustness measures that could be used by decision-makers to properly manage flooded transportation system. Most available measures related to network robustness assessment are qualitative, and while some recent studies have focused on such evaluation using quantitative assessment approaches related to environmental or socialeconomic operations, they lack the holistic view towards robustness under flood events. This study develops a composite multi-scale transportation-system robustness model considering flood hazards by synthesizing geographical damage recognition, topological functionality analysis, network operation evaluation, and traffic-user loss estimation. This integrated model has been applied in a real-world highway network, mainly revealing that a given intensive flood occurrence at different locations may result in a variety of after-flood disruptions in the transportation network. To assist the asset owners with developing more reasonable prevention and recovery plans, the developed multi-scale robustness index presents both visible multi-denominational flood consequences and an overall post-event transportation-system robustness indicator.","2020-06","2024-12-01 14:15:10","2024-12-01 14:15:10","2024-12-01 14:15:10","102281","","","83","","Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\Z3TZKT9I\Zhang and Alipour - 2020 - Multi-scale robustness model for highway networks .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although transportation engineers and planners have attempted to improve system resilience through the adaptation of new technologies and the implementation of various strategies to achieve effective risk management, it remains unclear how resilience performance (measured by the speed of recovery) of airports varies in different severe weather events and what factors may explain such variations. This paper addresses these fundamental questions using the aviation system in China as an example. A resilience metric, which reflects the speed of recovery (bounce back) from a shock, was developed to measure the performance of airport resilience under various severe weather conditions. In addition, an empirical econometric analysis was conducted based on a dataset that includes both detailed aviation performance and weather conditions for the period of October 2016 –September 2017. The research findings show that airport resilience to severe weather events does vary substantially based on factors, such as weather conditions, airport capacity, and the level of modal substitution. In particular, the recovery time of air services in central and south China tends to be relatively longer in thunderstorms than other weather conditions. The study also confirms that modal substitution is a very effective resilience tactic of the transportation system as the recovery speed of air service was found to be faster by 22.9% if an alternative mode, such as high-speed rail (HSR) service was also available in the city.","2020-06","2024-12-01 14:15:15","2024-12-01 14:15:16","2024-12-01 14:15:15","102362","","","83","","Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\Q9SITMMT\Zhou and Chen - 2020 - Measuring the performance of airport resilience to.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Urban areas are complex systems exposed to diﬀerent shocks, which have impacts on its various components. Research in transport has already incorporated the concept of resilience with more or less sophisticated approaches that are intensive on data and technical expertise. There is a need to explore the incorporation of resilience in simpler and less data intensive methods that can be easily applied in a wider range of contexts. One of the aims of this research is to develop a method that can use commonly available mobility management tools allowing smaller urban areas to analyse and plan for resilience. We present a new development of a method to assess resilience in transport systems with a commonly used mobility management tool (the origin-destination matrix) for calculating an overall measurement of resilience. The method assumes that car trips are transferred to active modes or to the available public transport routes in the event of any disruption in the system. We consider diﬀerent scenarios of availability of public transport in case of disruptive events. We applied the method to two urban areas in Brazil. The variation of the contribution of the public transport presents patterns comparable between the two cases. The spatial distribution of trips shows the relative importance of resilient trips and the cities’ spatial structure. The inclusion of public transport routes has an impact on the levels of accessibility of lower income users.","2020-08","2024-12-01 14:15:19","2024-12-01 14:15:20","2024-12-01 14:15:19","102386","","","85","","Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\ILZEF7ZM\Azolin et al. - 2020 - Incorporating public transport in a methodology fo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, existing studies in this field generally considered a one-time disaster event during a relatively short period, and thus became insufficient for assessing the resilience of road networks in an extreme environment with frequent disaster events. This paper aims to propose a Time-dependent Resilience Analysis Framework (TIDRAF) by modeling the dynamic resilience of a road network in an extreme environment (where there are frequent disruptive events) and sequential repair actions. The original resilience triangle diagram is extended into a long-term paradigm to fit the road network with its frequentdisaster environment. The road network in the Tibetan Plateau, which has for years severely suffered from frequent disaster events, was selected as the case to validate the proposed TIDRAF.

Thus, climate resilience and sustainable adaptation of infrastructure are of paramount importance. This paper puts forward a novel framework and metrics for optimising sustainability (Greenhouse Gas emissions - GHG), climate resilience (restoration time), and cost. The framework aims to facilitate decision-making by operators and stakeholders and communicate actionable trade-offs between these principles. It describes approaches for quantifying ex-ante adaptation and ex-post recovery from the lenses of sustainability and resilience using relevant metrics. This paper concludes with an application of the framework on a bridge, where nor­ malised metrics are integrated into one unique index (ISRC), which can be used in the recovery prioritisation for portfolios of similar assets. The optimisation program includes a bridge recov­ ery, while reducing GHG emissions. The impact of climate change on the sustainability and resilience indexes is examined and the results show how the optimum solutions are adversely affected by different climate projections. In all scenarios examined, more sustainable solutions leading to reduced GHG emissions (tCO2e) are the optimum solutions when weighing resilience and cost.

We demonstrate this framework through case studies under historical and stress-test TC scenarios in the Western North Pacific region. Results show that the GLSN can be quite resilient in typical or mild-stress scenarios, but the increasing decline in its resilience under higher stress levels signals significant risks when facing with extreme scenarios. Those least resilient countries under mild stress turn out to be the same countries exhibiting least resilience under severe stress, most of which are SIDS countries.

Additionally, the recovery priority of failed nodes to maximize network resilience is also discussed. The intercity coach/train timetable data and intercity travel data from the Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration in China were applied to demonstrate the application of the methods.

This study aims to address this issue by proposing a novel fuzzy chance-constrained two-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) model as an advanced and rigorous approach in the performance evaluation of sustainably resilient SCs. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is pioneering as it introduces a new fuzzy chance-constrained two-stage method that can be used to undertake the deterministic non-fuzzy programming of the proposed model. The proposed approach is validated and applied to evaluate a real case study including 21 major public transport providers in three megacities. The results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach in comparison to the existing approaches in the literature.","2021-12","2024-12-01 14:17:06","2024-12-01 14:17:06","2024-12-01 14:17:06","107879","","","113","","Applied Soft Computing","Sustainably resilient supply chains evaluation in public transport","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\NAJQ5E46\Izadikhah et al. - 2021 - Sustainably resilient supply chains evaluation in .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It builds upon previous analyses, which determine the cost-optimal design of CCTS supply chains while complying with specified emissions reduction scenarios, and determines optimal designs in terms of minimum cost and maximum resilience. The resilience of a supply chain is defined as its ability to permanently store the captured CO2 during the time horizon of interest, and it is quantified in terms of expected amount of carbon not stored under a fixed number of possible simultaneous failures. A mixed-integer linear program is developed to design CCTS supply chains that ensure a specified level of resilience while minimizing total system costs and CO2 emissions. The model is illustrated by determining the optimal decarbonization strategy in terms of costs and level of resilience for the Swiss waste-to-energy sector from 2025 to 2050. Overall, resilience is achieved with a cost increase with respect to the cost-optimal solution ranging from about 5% (backup truck connections to minimize the cost of the supply chain) to about 70% (backup pipeline connections to minimize the emissions of the supply chain) when the storage site is in the North Sea. When the storage site is available in Switzerland, the cost increase is much reduced and ranges from about 1% to 10% with respect to the cost-optimal solution.","2022-12","2024-12-01 14:17:11","2024-12-01 14:17:11","2024-12-01 14:17:11","103797","","","121","","International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control","Optimization and assessment of carbon capture, transport and storage supply chains for industrial sectors","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\FR5ZC67S\Gabrielli et al. - 2022 - Optimization and assessment of carbon capture, tra.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, the increasing threat of targeted attacks, natural hazards, and compound failures to PTNs has called for an urgent need to improve the resilience of critical lifeline systems. Here, we propose a new synthetic criterion for iden­ tifying the critical nodes of PTNs.

Their complex operations, connectedness to external stakeholders, and increasing volumes of goods to be handled make them vulnerable to internal and external disruptions. Research has shown that disruptions in seaports can cause undesirable ripple effects, which negatively impact the operations of the entire transportation network as well as the surrounding economical and societal wellbeing. Containerized transportation plays a major role in the global trade network. Resilience of seaport container terminals is therefore imperative for a resilient and robust intermodal transportation network. Communication, information sharing, alignment of plans, and shared awareness of unfolding disruptions among planners and decision makers within terminal operations have been identiﬁed as important elements to improve the resilience of container terminals. However, in practice, the inter-dependencies between various planning and operational activities, and alignment of solution strategies have been largely overlooked. Addressing this gap, a novel approach for creating awareness of potential strategies for disruption management by training competencies for resilient container terminal operations has been introduced in the form of a simulation game. Several test sessions of a multiplayer tabletop game support the following two ﬁndings—ﬁrst, the simulation game can be a useful means to train competencies for resilient transport operations from the perspective of the future planners and decision makers, as well as for soon-to-be professionals in container terminals.

In this study, we analyze the resilience of cities in the presence of airport disruptions. The major research question we address is: How much would the air accessibility of complete cities lose under the outage of a single airport? We perform a study at the global level, comparing the resilience of 5000 largest cities. Two types of passengerfocused measures are proposed to quantify the impact of airport disruption on the air accessibility of cities: The unaffected passengers and the reroutable passengers.

These could lead to undermine the accuracy of resilience assessment results. To ﬁll these research gaps, the paper synthetically assesses the resilience performance of interdependent infrastructure systems with the conditionvarying components leveraging the physics-based approaches to delineate the intricate operating scheme of each infrastructure system. A case study strives to investigate the pre-event resilience performance of interdependent stormwater drainage system and road transport system in Hong Kong against heavy rainfall. The results show that the component deterioration in the stormwater drainage system could cause incremental amount of inundated rainwater in certain manholes and thus lead to substantial degradation in traﬃc performance in the vicinity when compared to the scenario without considering the pre-event component condition. Simultaneously, certain intersections of the network as well as the spatially subordinated small-scaled network do not seem to be aﬀected while the traﬃc performance could even be advanced at those intersections. This phenomenon explains the heterogeneity of spatial and temporal traﬃc patterns within the same network. The results should help guide decision-makers identifying the vulnerabilities, planning pre-event mitigation strategies, and prioritizing recovery resources actions in case hazards occur.","2020-03","2024-12-01 14:17:30","2024-12-01 14:17:30","2024-12-01 14:17:30","101886","","","54","","Sustainable Cities and Society","Physics-based resilience assessment of interdependent civil infrastructure systems with condition-varying components","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\FLMV839U\Yang et al. - 2020 - Physics-based resilience assessment of interdepend.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the second part, strategies used for enhancing the resilience of EVs are discussed, which comprise onsite storage deployment, integration of renewable energy sources, design of off-grid charging stations, energy allocation to EVs during outages, and the use of EVs for evacuation during emergencies.

InfraRisk consists of an infrastructure module, a hazard module, a recovery module, a simulation module, and a resilience quantification module. The infrastructure module integrates existing infrastructure network packages (wntr for water distribution systems, pandapower for power systems, and a static traffic assignment model for road transport systems) through an interface that facilitates the network-level simulation of infrastructure failures. The hazard module generates infrastructure component failures based on various disaster characteristics. The recovery module determines repair sequences and assigns repair crews based on predefined heuristics-based recovery strategies or model predictive control (MPC) based optimization. Based on the schedule, the simulation module simulates the consequences of the disaster impacts and the recovery actions on the performance of the interdependent network. The resilience quantification module offers system-level and consumer-level metrics to quantify both the risks and resilience of the integrated infrastructure networks against disaster events. InfraRisk provides a virtual platform for decision-makers to experiment and develop region-specific pre-disaster and post-disaster policies to enhance the overall resilience of interdependent urban infrastructure networks.","2022-08","2024-12-01 14:17:44","2024-12-01 14:17:45","2024-12-01 14:17:44","103963","","","83","","Sustainable Cities and Society","InfraRisk","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\V9L9RUI2\Balakrishnan and Cassottana - 2022 - InfraRisk An open-source simulation platform for .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To account for real-world features, the traffic flow of TN is modeled according to traffic counter cameras of Sioux Falls city. In addition, the effects of blocked roads on TSSs’ movements through microgrids (MGs), and clearing operation of obstructions by repair crews are considered as these factors have a great impact on system oper­ ational cost. Further, an optimal reconfiguration program is proposed to add more flexibility to the system. The developed model is formulated as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and various case studies are pre­ sented including analyzing TSSs and repair crews’ operations, both individually and concurrently. Different case studies reveal the positive impact of TSSs, reducing the total cost of the system by approximately 13.11%.

Disruptions can have substantial negative effects, which are uncertain and unpredictable. One of the aspects of resiliency is prompt recovery of damage transportation infrastructure. Bridges, as one of the key components of transportation infrastructure, are highly exposed to damage by natural disasters. Efﬁcient restoration of damaged bridges can signiﬁcantly reduce the adverse impacts of a catastrophic event. Prepositioning of recovery centers to aid in the restoration of bridges is one mechanism to increase the efﬁciency of the recovery process because it reduces the lead time to damaged bridges once a disaster has occurred. The objective is to cluster the bridges and locate a recovery center for each cluster by considering operational cost and system reliability. To overcome the disruption of both the recovery centers and paths, an integer programming model is developed base on reliability facility location and most reliable path. Reliability facility location determines some backup recovery centers in case of disrupted primary one, and path reliability conducts assignment based upon most reliable path instead of the shortest path. The methodology is applied on the Sioux Falls real transportation network.

We propose a methodology to evaluate road recovery strategies for restoring connectivity after blockages due to earthquakes and earthquake-triggered landslides. This paper gives insight into the recovery process, which can be used by decision-makers for enhancing resilience and supplying immediate relief to rural areas. The proposed framework has four steps: 1) identiﬁcation of strategies for increasing recovery performance, 2) determination of graph-based metrics to represent network connectivity, 3) applying topology-based and Monte Carlo simulations to each strategy, and 4) analysis of recovery times to compare these resilience-enhancement strategies. The methodology was tested using a case study from Sindhupalchok District, Nepal, a region that was severely aﬀected by the Gorkha earthquake in 2015. The closed road segments and recovery times were determined through ﬁeld surveys with locals and governmental authorities, and by investigating the intensity of earthquake-triggered landslides.

Often cascading dysfunctionality or disruption in these critical infrastructure networks triggers chain reactions of blackouts or blockages through the system of highly interconnected infrastructure networks, and the disruption of surrounding societies. For the planning of restoration processes and resilience of these, social aspects and demographics should also be considered to assign and mitigate the possible social risks associated with these disruptions. In this work, we study the restoration planning of critical interdependent infrastructure networks after a possible disruptive event by mainly emphasizing on the vulnerability indices of interacting society. We integrate (i) a resilience-driven multi-objective mixed-integer programming formulation to schedule the restoration process of disrupted network components in each network with (ii) an index of social vulnerability that is geographically distributed. We present an illustrative example of the proposed integrated model that focuses on studying the community resilience in Shelby County, TN, United States.","2019-08","2024-12-01 14:18:13","2024-12-01 14:18:13","2024-12-01 14:18:13","101228","","","38","","International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\2EUR5JG4\Karakoc et al. - 2019 - Community resilience-driven restoration model for .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The disaster-induced effects on road links and their subsequent recovery to the pre-disaster state are functions of the designed network resilience. Thus, the investigation of traffic operations including speed and volume fluctuations during such disasters can provide useful insights into the resilience of the roadway network. Furthermore, identifying road links and corridors which are most affected during natural disasters and estimating the extent of the effect on traffic are crucial steps in devising traffic management strategies for mitigating future hazards. A key challenge to the realization of the above objectives is the lack of data pertaining to roadway and traffic conditions during natural disasters. While modern sensing technologies based on non-Dedicated Short-Range (wireless) Communications such as Bluetooth® have been widely adopted to track traffic performance, they need to be corroborated with supplementary data for a complete characterization of the prevalent traffic conditions. In this study, an alter­ native method is presented for identifying the traffic fluctuations induced by a natural disaster (Hurricane Harvey) on an urban traffic network (Houston) by studying the characteristics of extreme travel time observa­ tions. The study relies on time series decomposition and anomaly detection algorithms to investigate the spatiotemporal effects of the hurricane on the traffic conditions. The results of the case study suggest that the metrics developed are effective in quantifying the resilience of traffic networks against natural disasters by capturing both the initial impact and recovery. The study showed that the Houston freeway network was not completely recovered from the effects of Hurricane Harvey, even three weeks after the occurrence of the hurricane.","2020-08","2024-12-01 14:18:18","2024-12-01 14:18:18","2024-12-01 14:18:18","101565","","","47","","International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\TQNG8XFT\Balakrishnan et al. - 2020 - Mapping resilience of Houston freeway network duri.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to emergency medical vehicles, most injured residents are often transported to hospitals by private vehicles. Unlike emergency vehicles, private vehicles carrying injured people don't have the driving privilege and therefore become part of regular traffic. Meanwhile, there is usually considerable traffic from dislocated people subjected to various levels of road disruptions following earthquakes. A realistic and efficient assessment of the resilience performance of the disrupted transportation network during the emergency medical response is crucial to saving as many lives as possible through optimal emergency response planning. This study proposes a new methodology to quantify the resilience of disrupted transportation networks during the emergency response stage considering private-vehicle-based injury transport and evacuation traffic. The proposed methodology simulates the traffic during the emergency medical service using the dynamic traffic assignment method by considering various road disruptions. A resilience index is proposed based on the traffic efficiency of the hospitalization trips and uncertainties in earthquakes and infrastructure vulnerability. Finally, the reasonable number of EMS vehicles is investigated from the optimal emergency medical transportation perspective.","2023-07","2024-12-01 14:18:22","2024-12-01 14:18:22","2024-12-01 14:18:22","103754","","","93","","International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\FMLX538J\Wu and Chen - 2023 - Traffic resilience modeling for post-earthquake em.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, such infrastructures are exposed to natural and anthropogenic hazards that have caused structural failures, traffic disruptions, injuries and fatalities, and damages to the environment. These past events have underscored the need for more resilient transportation systems. However, reducing risks and achieving more resilient infrastructure systems may result in greater resource consumption and environmental impacts, demanding the consideration of sustainability requirements in the management of TIS. Therefore, this paper conducts an exploratory study to map the current knowledge in the domain of risk, resilience, and sustainability management of TIS. As a first step, the system identification of TIS in the context of their management is conducted for the purpose of providing the basis for searching for relevant information. This step sets the baseline for conducting a bibliometric analysis of 16,395 scientific works extracted from the Scopus database between 1990 and 2022. Two quantitative bibliometric techniques are used, namely term co-occurrence and bibliographic coupling. The former technique allows to distinguish the different disciplinary contributions and to identify research gaps. The latter technique facilitates the identification of the main contributors (authors and countries) and the relatedness of research communities. The bibliometric analysis performed provides the basis for future research and development to improve the management of TIS and highlights the potential for transferring knowledge from other research domains.","2023-10","2024-12-01 14:18:27","2024-12-01 14:18:27","2024-12-01 14:18:27","104063","","","97","","International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\2VZ62CTQ\Santamaria-Ariza et al. - 2023 - An exploratory bibliometric analysis of risk, resi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experience from past disastrous events shows that transportation infrastructures are quite vulnerable due to the lack of redundancy, the lengthy repair time, the rerouting difficulties or the cascading failures and interdependencies. Their damage could be greatly disruptive in terms of safety of life, business disruption, access to emergency services and key lifelines utilities, rescue operations and socioeconomic impacts.

These systems are often considered critical because they are necessary for the organization, functionality, and stability of a modern industrialized country. However, these infrastructures are vulnerable to accidents, malicious failures, and disruptions that could generate consequences impacting on the economy, health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of a country or of several neighboring countries. The disruption of critical cross-border transportation infrastructure, road or rail, as a result of a major event can affect the area where the event occurs and a wider area. Depending on the type and duration of an event, which can be natural or anthropogenic in origin, it is possible to estimate the impacts on the mobility of people and goods in terms of delays (alternative routes), increased traffic (congestion), and a potential increase in accidents. For instance, in 2019 there was an accident in Rastatt (Germany) that affected rail traffic on the Karlsruhe-Basel line of the Rhine-Alpine corridor in Europe. The rail line was disrupted for more than 50 days, causing disservices and about 2 billion Euro in economic losses in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. The extended disruption of road and rail sections can have consequences (impacts) not only on the transport system but also on the socio-economic system in a macro-regional context. The research is part of the SICt project - Resilience of Critical Cross-Border Infrastructure developed in the Interreg VA ItalySwitzerland Programme 2014-2020. The work aims to define a RI - Resilience Index for the road and rail transport network falling within the study area. The RI index describes the capability of each network element (i-th link) to cope with a relevant event. The formulation of the index involves the calculation of three independent indicators: i) RIRM - Rescue Management related to the resources that can be activated and used to cope with an event; ii) RIPP - Plans & Management related to the speed with which the necessary resources can be activated and in fact, considers management aspects such as the presence of plans and procedures; iii) RIRN - Network & Traffic related to the robustness of the elements of the transport network. This work aims to present the proposed model and its application to the project area that includes the Lombardy Region (Italy) and the Canton Ticino (Switzerland) within the SICt Project.","2023","2024-12-01 14:19:07","2024-12-01 14:19:08","2024-12-01 14:19:07","77-84","","","69","","Transportation Research Procedia","Cross-border critical transportation infrastructure","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\8MAZ6DFI\Borghetti and Marchionni - 2023 - Cross-border critical transportation infrastructur.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Networked microgrids (MGs) with distributed generation resources provide a viable solution for the resilience enhancement of power systems. However, most literature utilizes centralized control methods based on energy management systems to model networked MGs and employs static storage units to enhance resilience, which are both unrealistic. In this paper, a hierarchical control approach based on detailed AC OPF algorithm is developed to capture technical constraints relating to voltage, angle and power loss as well as obtaining accurate solutions of power exchange between MGs, while the routing of electric vehicles (EVs) is incorporated into the model to reduce load shedding during extreme events. Uncertainties relating to load profiles and renewable energy sources are captured via stochastic programming. The impacts of limited generation resources and different levels of contingencies (including multiple line faults) are captured in the model to mimic a realistic scenario and verify the effectiveness of the proposed resilience enhancement strategy. Appropriate sensitivity analyses are suggested to investigate the influence of uncertain event occurrence time, tie-line capacity and EV scheduling horizon.","2021-06","2024-12-01 14:19:35","2024-12-01 14:19:35","2024-12-01 14:19:35","100464","","","26","","Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\VJCBP6PP\Wang et al. - 2021 - A resilience enhancement strategy for networked mi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under the disasters, the energy supply capability from the utility grid system to the end-user microgrids is decreased, which is due to the destruction of the system infrastructure. Thus, how to improve the resilience of the microgrids under disasters is an essential problem. In this paper, a mobile hydrogen truck-assisted methodology is proposed to deliver hydrogen tanks to end-user microgrids via transportation network to resist to the natural disasters. First, a temporal–spatial destructive model of the natural disasters based on the grid division is presented, and the dynamical energy supply ability of an IEEE30+gas20+heat14 utility grid system is derived. Second, a hydrogen tank delivering model from hydrogen company to microgrids based on transportation network is presented. Third, a real-world transportation network based on SUMO simulator is linked with Matlab to simulate the real-time coupling between transportation network and power network. Last, microgrids optimal operation based on the temporal–spatial destructive model and hydrogen tank delivering model is presented. The simulation results show that with the assistance of the arrived hydrogen tanks through real-world transportation network in microgrid, one can indeed reduce load shedding. However, when considering the damaged transportation network, the saving loads are reduced due to the increase of the mobile hydrogen storage delivery time. It reveals that delivering mobile hydrogen tanks to end-user microgrids can effectively improve the system resilience.","2023-10","2024-12-01 14:19:55","2024-12-01 14:19:55","2024-12-01 14:19:55","100265","","","18","","eTransportation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\8JHJYCX6\Li et al. - 2023 - Improve multi-energy supply microgrid resilience u.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is found that the dynamic migration of lithium compounds produced by NCAL anode in the cell with Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ (GDC) as electrolyte during the constant current durability test is the main reason for the cell performance degradation. In this paper, we found that adding different mass ratios of NaFeO2 to the GDC electrolyte to construct GDC/NaFeO2 composite elec­ trolyte can significantly affect the durability of the cell. Under the constant current density test conditions of 550 ◦C, 0.2 A cm− 2, the performance of the cell with GDC/NaFeO2 composite with a mass ratios of 8/2 as electrolyte maintained relatively good durability in the constant current test of 50 h. The characterization results show that the NaFeO2 reacts with lithium compounds such as LiOH to generate LiFeO2 and NaOH, and NaFeO2 is reduced to Fe and NaOH by H2. A proper amount of NaFeO2 in the GDC/NaFeO2 composite electrolyte can produce sodium compound molten salt during the performance test to replace the role of lithium compound molten salt in improving the electrolyte ionic conductivity and the cell sealing, while slowing down the dynamic migration of the molten salt in the cell, thus improving the durability of the cell. The findings in this paper provide evidence and relevant theories for the performance degradation and durability improvement mechanism of this new type of lithium compound electrode ceramic fuel cell (LCCFCs), and propose new strategies for obtaining LCCFCs with better durability.","2023-10","2024-12-01 14:19:59","2024-12-01 14:20:00","2024-12-01 14:19:59","100276","","","18","","eTransportation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\63RWMHSV\Wei et al. - 2023 - Durability of advanced low temperature lithium com.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Transportation systems play a key role in the event of a disaster. Hence adequate transportation system resilience to ﬂoods is critical to ensure high‐performing cities in the long term. We review the laws and policies pertaining to ﬂood resilience in each city and conduct ﬂoodplain analysis of critical transportation networks using geographic information systems to understand the relative susceptibility of expressway networks to ﬂooding. The ﬁndings highlight differences in approaches to developing system resilience in different cities, related to geographic, cultural, and institutional factors, and linked with transportation network performance in ﬂood events. The study is potentially useful for transportation engineers, urban planners, and policymakers, offering insights and examples for building institutional and technical capital for ﬂood resilience.

Recently, the nascent concept of “resilience hubs” has emerged to help communities overcome these challenges and improve well-being during disasters and everyday conditions. This paper provides an early conceptual understanding of resilience hubs, in particular their associated transportation needs, through a comprehensive literature review. The review identified characteristics and needs for planning hubs by focusing on their current definitions and related concepts (e.g., evacuation shelters, mobility hubs). In all, the review identified that resilience hubs could be a successful tool for communities in addressing the important needs of residents, evacuees, and survivors. However, we found that the placement of hubs is not methodical or optimized, and hubs have yet to be evaluated using metrics or key performance indicators. Critically, most literature and examples of resilience hubs fail to consider: 1) how people and relief supplies will travel to/from hubs, or 2) potential transportation services that could be offered by hubs. We recommend that programs that identify, design, and create resilience hubs should emphasize mechanisms for providing reliable and equitable transportation for people and relief supplies.","2022-12","2024-12-01 14:20:09","2024-12-01 14:20:10","2024-12-01 14:20:09","100697","","","16","","Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\YGVQB752\Ciriaco and Wong - 2022 - Review of resilience hubs and associated transport.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on a mixed-method study in Berlin (Germany), Brussels (Belgium), Stockholm (Sweden) and Tallinn (Estonia), we show how the pandemic outbreak has changed both who uses public transport and how users experience their journeys. Challenging the narratives that portray public transport as a place of fear, we find that remaining passengers assess the risk of contagion lower than those who avoided it completely. We argue that promoting resilient public transport re­ quires policies that address the needs of passengers relying on public transport services.

Military actions have severely disrupted transport routes, leading to supply chain disruptions and triggering economic sanctions that have impacted global supply chains. The aim of the research is to identify key factors influencing the resilience of EU and Ukrainian transport logistics during the Russian-Ukrainian war, along with governmental policies aimed at enhancing this resilience. The hypothesis posited in the article suggests that ensuring transport logistics resilience during wartime is impossible without intergovernmental coordination and cooperation in route planning, infrastructure modernization, financing, and regulatory adaptation. To achieve this research aim, a combination of general scientific and specific methods was employed: historical and logical approaches, statistical analysis and aggregation, and the logical method. The article identifies three main attributes that define transport logistics resilience: the ability to withstand shock impacts, adaptability to shock impacts, and the ability to recover after shock impacts. Key challenges in business in Ukraine due to damaged transport infrastructure and logistics have been highlighted. Measures to ensure transport logistics resilience in Ukraine during wartime include transparent logistics system architecture, alternative delivery routes, cooperation and building reliable partnerships, and measures for monitoring and evaluating system effectiveness. Factors influencing transport logistics resilience in Ukraine and the EU have been determined, including the efficiency of customs and border procedures, the quality of trade and transport infrastructure, ease of organizing international deliveries at competitive prices, competence and quality of logistics services, and the ability to track shipments and ensure timely delivery to destinations. A comprehensive approach is proposed, encompassing infrastructure, organiza­tional, technological, and economic measures to ensure transport logistics resilience.","2024-09-05","2024-12-01 14:21:00","2024-12-01 14:21:00","2024-12-01 14:21:00","108-127","","4","135","","FT","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\WC6774ZI\Lebedeva and Shkuropadska - 2024 - Resilience of transport logistics in EU and Ukrain.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is due to the absence of mathemati­ cal models able to translate this awareness into appropriate financial models. Nowadays a city no longer exists as mere physical built place, but as a dematerialized “cloud” of flows: people, goods, information. The vicious circle is all here: the car has allowed the urban sprawl; mass transit does not allow the widespread use of a city. This is the time of urban sustainability. If each urban element (home-work-facilities) is framed dynamically within the daily circadian rhythm that connects them, it will be possible to develop a sustainable solution that is not partialized on a specific sector. A balanced city produces social wealth: that turns into a financial one because it can be measured. The paper presents a methodology that combines the most modern epide­ miological knowledge and the energy aspects of mobility. The Enhanced Financial Analysis (EFA) approach considers the Public authority as investor and manager of a planned infrastructure. Revenues come from fare and savings on current health expenditure. The model explores the morbidity of some peculiar diseases of which there is an identified cause-and-effect pollution (direct and indirect) and air quality. The avoided health expenditure is measured by health services that will not be paid out in the medium and long term compared with the do-nothing scenario. EFA allows introjecting some aspects that usually are relegated to the economic analysis, but are part of the current spending of the funder. This realizes a comprehensive financial analysis of the possible alternative technologies for a mass transit corridor, correcting the bias that may arise on the electrical transport—even on the rail transport—compared with apparently less expensive choices.","2017-03-16","2024-12-01 14:21:09","2024-12-01 14:21:10","2024-12-01 14:21:09","891-898","","","","","","","","","","","CRC Press","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1201/9781315281896-114","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\H6JBZTSY\Spinosa - 2017 - Enhanced financial analysis to evaluate mass trans.pdf","","","","Dell’Acqua, Gianluca; Wegman, Fred","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"JR3UGNPQ","journalArticle","","","Resilience modelling and assessment","","","","","","The objective of this paper is to develop a method to evaluate the resilience of multi-state systems. Resilience measures the ability of a system to withstand, adapt to and quickly recover from unanticipated events, e.g., natural disasters or malicious attacks. Multi-state systems are frequently encountered in practice. However, to the best of our knowledge, few existing research has been done to model the resilience of multi-state systems. In this paper, we extend the concept of resilience triangle and define a stochastic metric to describe the resilience of multi-state systems. The theory of aggregated stochastic processes, matrix theory and Laplace transform are employed to analyze the resilience of multi-state systems using the defined metric. Finally, a numerical case study is illustrated.","","2024-12-01 14:21:13","2024-12-01 14:21:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\R6CE3UPL\Resilience modelling and assessment.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What are the issues arising from urban governance? Using Ghana as a case study, this chapter examines changing approaches to urban resilience and the planning and management experience. Consideration of the resilience philosophy in Ghana’s urban governance is limited as compared to developed and other developing countries because of: limited planning and management agency capacity in implementing resilience principles; rapid urbanisation contributing to unplanned and informal settlements; and severe impacts of climate change. The forces of rapid urbanisation and climate change constitute the main threat to urban sustainability in Ghana, magnified by the weak urban planning and management regimes within the fragile and evolving local urban governance system.

This approach has more significance given the diminishing public sector investment in public transport in developing countries that has led to the growth of informal transport.

The challenges of increasing congestion and negative environmental impacts, shifting trips from personal vehicles to other transport options is generally seen as one of the most important actions. In terms of resilience and business continuity, transport systems need to be efﬁcient as well as robust, as their vulnerability may cause various negative impacts. The methodological approach is particularly useful for planning resilient response in the preparedness stage, prioritizing investment for mitigation and adaptation, and prioritizing the rehabilitation (access restoration) of the disrupted links in the response and recovery stages.

At the neighbourhood level, enhanced mobility can be achieved through investment in transport infrastructure, which in turn can promote greater community interaction and exchange, and in the process contribute to social resilience. This study examines the inﬂuence of transport infrastructure investment on household work and non-work travel demand in Singapore, with the main purpose of investigating whether improved transport accessibility brought by transport infrastructure investment prompts additional out-home trips; and if so, to what extent and in what way does transport infrastructure investment inﬂuence household travel demand. Our study indicates that the travel demand for both work and non-work purposes is mainly determined by households’ socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Rail transit accessibility and expressway proximity do not inﬂuence travel demand signiﬁcantly. Land use mix and population density have a positive inﬂuence, though small in magnitude, on household travel demand, and consequently on mobility, which contributes to greater social resilience.","2020","2024-12-01 14:22:32","2024-12-01 14:22:32","2024-12-01 14:22:32","63-79","","","","","","Urban Mobility and Resilience","","","","","Springer Singapore","Singapore","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Series Title: Advances in 21st Century Human Settlements DOI: 10.1007/978-981-13-7048-9_5","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\NHCR26MY\Song et al. - 2020 - Urban Mobility and Resilience Transport Infrastru.pdf","","","","Leong, Chan-Hoong; Malone-Lee, Lai-Choo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper highlights the impacts of climate change on ﬂooding hazards and the resulting damage to the Doha metro network. We applied a complex network approach to assess the resilience of the network under different scenarios. The results show no damage suffered under the base case; however, several stations and sections of the network are impacted under climate change scenarios. Thus, as the impacts of climate change are becoming more evident, it is critical to revisit development plans and precautions to reinforce or redesign critical infrastructures to avoid catastrophic events and substantial economic losses.

The granularity of the GPS data necessary for this analysis is relatively coarse; it only requires coordinates for the beginning and end of trips, the metered distance, and the total travel time. The method works by computing the historical distribution of pace (normalized travel times) between various regions of a city and measuring the pace deviations during an unusual event. This method is applied to a dataset of nearly 700 million taxi trips in New York City, which is used to analyze the transportation infrastructure resilience to Hurricane Sandy. The analysis indicates that Hurricane Sandy impacted traﬃc conditions for more than ﬁve days, and caused a peak delay of two minutes per mile. Practically, it identiﬁes that the evacuation caused only minor disruptions, but signiﬁcant delays were encountered during the postdisaster reentry process.

Using the three IPW-based decision metrics, a stage-wise decision process is then formulated as a stochastic multiobjective optimization problem, which includes a project ranking mechanism to identify pre-disaster network retrofit projects in Phase I, a prioritization approach for temporary repairs to facilitate immediate post-disaster emergency responses in Phase II, and a methodology for scheduling network-wide repairs during the long-term recovery of the roadway system in Phase III. Finally, this stage-wise decision framework is applied to the roadway network of Shelby County, TN, USA subjected to seismic hazards, to illustrate its implementation in supporting community network resilience planning.","","2024-12-01 14:23:01","2024-12-01 14:23:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\HA5JW845\Zhang et al. - A Stage-wise Decision Framework for Transportation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on systemic thinkings and sustainability perspectives, we investigate the long-term resilience of the road transportation systems in four cities of China from 1998 to 2017, namely Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing, respectively. The model takes into account the factors involved in stages of design, construction, operation, management, and innovation of urban road transportation, which collected from multi-source data platforms. We test the model with the forward inference, sensitivity analysis, and backward inference. The result shows that the overall resilience of all four cities’ transportation infrastructure is within a moderate range with values between 50% to 60%. Although they all have an ever-increasing economic level, Beijing and Tianjin demonstrate a clear “V” shape in the long-term transportation resilience, which indicates a strong multidimensional, dynamic, and non-linear characteristic in resilience-economic coupling eﬀect. Additionally, the results obtained from the sensitivity analysis and backward inference suggest that urban decision-makers should pay more attention to the capabilities of quick rebuilding and making changes to cope with future disturbance.

This is accomplished by increasing the capacity of bus services that run in parallel with affected metro lines as well as those connecting to different metro lines. Our analysis starts with a network representation to model the integrated metro and bus system. A two-stage stochastic programming model is further developed to assess the intrinsic metro network resilience as well as to optimize the localized integration with bus services.

Of these risks, sea level rise is the most important for coastal regions in the long-term. The projections of sea level rise for the next eighty years show a range of 0.8 ft. to 6.5 ft. Furthermore, the risk of sea level rise coupled with storm surge will increase the vulnerability of coastal transportation infrastructure including bridges, roads, tunnels, ports, and harbors.

What can the various transport modes learn from each other regarding resilience and autonomy; and more specifically, what issues are of interest for the maritime sector? The results show that resilience has been identified as an important enabler for safety and security of autonomous systems, with increased attention from 2017. Many of the papers discuss resilience in the context of safety improvements, or resilience against system failures. Most of the literature covers autonomy in road traffic and aviation. Findings from these modes can provide input to design and enhance resilience of maritime autonomy. As an example, the importance and resilience of infrastructure (i.e. intelligent infrastructure support) supporting autonomy in aviation and road traffic may be explored in improving resilience of maritime autonomy. The breadth of security issues from road transportation should be explored in the maritime industry.

Airports are the important nodes in the aviation system network, and the failure of a single airport can often affect the surrounding airports. The purpose of our analysis is to show how is the resilience and recovery of airports in the global public health crisis. Much research on resilience can be found in air transportation networks facing natural hazards or extreme weather, which focus on the robustness of the airport network. These methods are not suitable for the global public health event. Therefore, based on the collection of existing data, we combined with existing resilience measurement methods to analyze the resilience and recovery of airports during the global public health crisis. The resilience metrics results reflect the recovery of airports very well under different strategies. Here, we analyze airport network resilience by considering the performance-based methods. We integrate some metrics such as aircraft movements, passenger throughput, and freight throughput in the resilience metrics model, comparing the resilience evaluation under different preventive and control strategies, which can reflect the airport’s recovery speed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis indicates that the aviation system network deteriorates soon after the COVID-19 outbreak, but the recovery level of the aviation industry depends on what measures are taken to prevent and control the COVID-19 epidemic. In particular, the recovery of the aviation system network in Europe takes longer than in China, due to different prevention and control strategies for COVID-19. The study proves that the emergency response ability of the country for the public health crisis has a significant positive impact on speeding up the recovery of the aviation system.","2021-02-04","2024-12-01 14:23:55","2024-12-01 14:23:55","2024-12-01 14:23:55","1-13","","","2021","","Mathematical Problems in Engineering","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\KQDR5KMH\Guo et al. - 2021 - Resilience Modeling Method of Airport Network Affe.pdf","","","","Rodino, Luigi","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Like conventional electric vehicles, SAEVs can provide power grids with ancillary services. This article proposes a new scheduling scheme for SAEV fleets within a cooperative plan to let power distribution networks benefit from the energy storage of vehicle batteries in recovering critical loads after a predictable extreme event. According to a long-term contract, the detailed request of the distribution system operator (DSO), together with desired constraints and perquisites, is sent to the SAEVs aggregator (SA) prior to the landfall of a predictable extreme event. Afterward, SA runs a targeted algorithm to schedule trip assignments and charging cycles of SAEVs so that the required constraints of DSO are satisfied. The SAEV participants will continue carrying passengers within the scheduled time horizon in addition to delivering energy to the distribution network at the scheduling deadline declared by DSO. This deadline is the time instant when the capacity of the SAEV fleet may be no more applicable to enhance the system preparedness against the approaching event. Numerical results illustrated that the proposed scheme helps improve the power grid resilience by delivering 2396.1 kWh of energy to the distribution network in addition to increasing the total income of each participant SAEV by about 130%. Thus, it is implied that the proposed method offers a win-win situation for both entities.","2023-04-14","2024-12-01 14:23:59","2024-12-01 14:24:00","2024-12-01 14:23:59","1-14","","","2023","","Journal of Advanced Transportation","Resilience-Oriented Scheduling of Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicles","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\WPV4QS9P\Amirioun et al. - 2023 - Resilience-Oriented Scheduling of Shared Autonomou.pdf","","","","Liu, Tao","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Transportation diversity, i.e., the availability and distribution of transportation modes across a community, impacts the mode complementarity, which can affect population movements and connectivity among spatial units—especially during extreme events when a failure in one mode can be compensated by other modes. However, few quantitative efforts have explored the impact of physical infrastructure configurations, and more specifically transportation diversity, on urban mobility and connectivity in an actual disaster context. In this paper, we measure transportation diversity with two factors—functional richness and functional evenness translated from the concept of diversity in ecological systems. Disaster resilience is regarded as a dynamic process pre, during, and post disaster in distinct communities and is tracked and quantified based on geospatial Twitter data of population cross-ZIP code tabulation areas movements with an ecology-inspired method—Fisher information—over time. Specifically, we compared the resilience of different neighborhoods in the city of Houston in Hurricane Harvey and found that neighborhoods with a higher level of transportation diversity demonstrated higher resiliency in their mobility during and after the hurricane. This study contributes to understanding how the availability and distribution of transportation infrastructure can impact the disaster resilience of human-infrastructure systems in urban areas.

This study introduces an empirical approach to evaluate road network resilience using crowdsourced traﬃc data in Google Maps. Based on the conceptualization of resilience and the Hansen accessibility index, resilience of road network is measured from accumulated accessibility reduction over time during a hazard. The utility of this approach is demonstrated in a case study of the Cleveland metropolitan area (Ohio) in Winter Storm Harper. The results reveal strong spatial variations of the disturbance and recovery rate of road network performance during the hazard. The major ﬁndings of the case study are: (1) longer distance travels have higher increasing ratios of travel time during the hazard; (2) communities with low accessibility at the normal condition have lower road network resilience; (3) spatial clusters of low resilience are identiﬁed, including communities with low socio-economic capacities. The introduced approach provides ground-truth validation for existing quantitative models and supports disaster management and transportation planning to reduce hazard impacts on road network.","2020-12-01","2024-12-01 14:24:08","2024-12-01 14:24:08","2024-12-01 14:24:08","2434-2450","","12","34","","International Journal of Geographical Information Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\TFMC4SVX\Qiang and Xu - 2020 - Empirical assessment of road network resilience in.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The framework incorporates the physical network of these infrastructures, social vulnerability indicators, and predictive analytics for a sociotechnical resilience assessment. It enables us to measure the impact of random failures due to aging infrastructures, natural disasters, and their cascading failures. We applied the proposed framework to the City of Tampa, FL. The results indicated that areas with higher social vulnerability are more prone to cascading failures caused by both random breakdowns and natural disasters. While natural disasters aﬀect all land use classes similarly, random failures have a greater impact on residential and institutional land use. The ﬁndings of this study highlight that infrastructure interdependency and the consequences of cascading failures should be taken into account in a coordinated infrastructure resilience assessment and planning.

The question is, why there has been so little policy action? This paper proposes that dealing with the complex changes involved in the transition to oil supply contraction requires new kinds of engineering modeling and analysis. There are no miracle technologies that will mitigate the need for major policy, economic, infrastructure and land use changes. Researchers have the responsibility to develop new methods and tools necessary for policy makers and planners to manage this change in direction. Without the right tools, the policy choice is between denying the problem and hoping for miracles. With the right Transition Engineering tools, the policy choices involve changes in land use, incentives, taxes and investments that efficiently reduce vulnerability and risk, increase adaptive capacity and build resilience. For more than a decade, the research and development program at the Advanced Energy and Material Systems Lab (AEMSLab) has focused on Transition Engineering. The first Transition Engineering project assesses vulnerability and risk to essential activities from oil supply contraction in the near and long term. The risk assessment method employs a probabilistic model of future fuel availability and an impact model of travel behavior adaptation to meet the probable fuel constraint. The second project is to assess travel adaptive capacity of current travel behavior and of the current urban forms using a new kind of travel survey, and to develop adaptation models for different urban development scenarios. Another important analysis is the active mode accessibility of the current urban form. The model uses GIS data and an activity model based on the demographic profile.

Awareness of natural hazards and extreme weather events has also increased with recent catastrophic hurricanes, such as Matthew (October, 2016) and Harvey (August, 2017), which caused significant inland floods in Robeson County, North Carolina, and Houston, Texas, respectively. These recent events and the damage to transportation infrastructure has also focused attention on the resilience of transportation networks. However, an integrated, consistent, well-understood method to assess or quantify the resilience of transportation networks is still lacking. This paper reviews the relevant concepts, legislative requirements that link asset management, risk and resilience, and tools available to support risk-based asset management. Based on a review of the transportation asset management plans developed by 49 state departments of transportation in 2018 and 2019, the paper summarizes the approaches to the risk management section of these asset management plans and the role resilience plays. Opportunities to better integrate resilience into the risk-based asset management plans are then identified.

The indicator can be used to detect poorly resilient road sections and to analyse which underlying road and traffic characteristics cause this non-resilience. The method adds to related concepts such as robustness and vulnerability by also considering recovery from congestion events explicitly and by focussing on everyday operational traffic situations rather than just on disasters or major events.

This paper examines the influence of the system optimal and user equilibrium traffic assignments on the last four dimensions. No widely accepted measurement of resilience is available for transportation systems; this paper presents multiple metrics for the four examined contributing components that will aid future development of a single measure of resilience.

Motivated by this observation, this paper has two interwoven objectives: On one hand, the vulnerability of road network under different types of targeted disruptions is characterized; on the other hand, a vulnerability measure based on the expected size of the giant components of the network under an uncertain disruptive event has been proposed. In order to achieve these objectives, first, the road network is represented as planar graphs and targeted disruption percolation patterns were simulated based on the values of the node -significance metrics. Second, the probability distribution of the giant component under uncertain disruptive events is modeled using the co-location index of the road network with flood control infrastructure. Third, percolations at different extents are simulated in order to estimate the giant components of the network under disruptions of different magnitudes, which, together with the probability estimated in the above step, is used to estimate the expected size of the giant connected component of the road network. The proposed method was applied to super neighborhoods in Houston during Hurricane Harvey. Comparisons are made among the vulnerabilities of different geographical locations, which lead to the identification of disasterprone areas. It is found that the proposed method is capable of identifying areas that would have a lower level of connectivity as a result of a possible flooding event.","2020-08-31","2024-12-01 14:25:13","2024-12-01 14:25:14","2024-12-01 14:25:13","35-47","","","","","","Characterization of Resilience of Networks to Uncertain Disruptions","","","","","American Society of Civil Engineers","Seattle, Washington (Conference Cancelled)","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\L33RSYUM\Abdulla and Birgisson - 2020 - Characterization of Resilience of Networks to Unce.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","International Conference on Transportation and Development 2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article presents a two-sided framework for use by any organisation to develop climate-change-ready transport infrastructure, regardless of their current level of knowledge or preparedness for climate change. The framework is composed of an adaptation strategy and an implementation plan, and has the overarching ambition to embed climate change adaptation within organisational procedures so it becomes a normal function of business. It advocates adaptation pathways, i.e., sequential adaptive actions that do not compromise future actions. The circular, iterative structure ensures new knowledge, or socio-economic changes may be incorporated, and that previous adaptations are evaluated. Moreover, the framework aligns with existing asset management procedures (e.g., ISO standards) or governmental or organisational approaches to climate change adaptation.

The magnitude and signiﬁcance of impacts were determined and knowledge of network robustness was built up based on existing climate data and on future trends. Various spatial databases were integrated and a four-stage transport model was used to explore the likely impacts of network degradation. The pattern of the network was assessed via both node- and link-based measurements, where different road databases, namely TRANS-TOOLS and Tele Atlas/TomTom, were employed in order to analyze the impact of spatial resolution within network connectivity analyses. This general framework developed for European Union, was tested on a speciﬁc and articulated case study area; namely, the north-east coastal region of Spain. The research conducted, yielded useful methods for the analysis of network vulnerability, where impacts are more signiﬁcant in regional accessibility patterns. Accessibility indicators at the regional level changed drastically, with some regions showing up to a 26% decrease. According to the results of network connectivity indicators, the changes in network topology have reduced the number of alternative routes and placed more pressure on the transport system. The implementation of this framework and quantitative assessment methodologies outlined in this paper could be employed to assist policy makers to recognize the opportunities that may arise or diminish the adverse effects.","2015-11","2024-12-01 14:25:36","2024-12-01 14:25:36","2024-12-01 14:25:36","62-76","","","81","","Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\7N96W696\Demirel et al. - 2015 - A framework to analyze the vulnerability of Europe.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This makes use of form of the network which combines the topology of the system and the capacity of the connecting links.

In this paper we present agent-based modelling and simulation (ABMS) as an approach towards this end. An agent-based model of a sociotechnical system describes the performance and interactions of its constituent human operators and technical systems in an operational context. In support of RE it can effectively be used to analyse the capability of a sociotechnical system to deal with disturbances and performance variability. We present an RE cycle, which uses qualitative and quantitative ABMS phases for analysis of the adaptive capacity of a sociotechnical system. The focus in this paper is on the qualitative ABMS phase, including the development of a qualitative model and mental simulation using the qualitative model. The model development is supported by a set of model constructs, which represent key aspects of evolution of agents’ states and agents’ interactions. The mental simulations use reasoning on the basis of the qualitative model to structurally analyse the interactions and dynamics of the performance in the agent-based model. Results of the qualitative ABMS phase can be used to improve the resilience of operations or they may be followed by quantitative ABMS.

The objective of this research was to develop a resilience model of the surface transportation system with a mixed-traffic environment and considering varying Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) penetration scenarios. As deployment of CAVs is expected to improve traffic operations, a resilience model was developed in this research to evaluate the resilience performance of a transportation system with several CAV penetration levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) for a given budget and recovery time. The proposed resilience quantification model was applied on a roadway network considering several disaster scenarios. The network capacity in relation to trips at any phase of disaster was compared with the pre-disaster trips to determine the system resilience. The capacity variation and the travel time variation were also estimated. The analysis showed that the resilience of the transportation system improved with CAVs in relation to travel time and capacity improvement. Link travel times were significantly improved by higher CAV penetration rate. The findings also suggested that higher penetration of CAVs (i.e., 50% or more) increased the recovery costs. For example, the recovery costs needed for medium and large-scale disasters were 50% and 90% higher, respectively, compared with the recovery costs for a small-scale disaster. These higher costs were primarily for the repair and replacement of intelligent infrastructure required to support the operation of CAVs.","2019-09","2024-12-01 14:25:50","2024-12-01 14:25:50","2024-12-01 14:25:50","562-574","","9","2673","","Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\85BUWT56\Ahmed et al. - 2019 - Evaluation of Transportation System Resilience in .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, such systems may experience loss of functionality because of external shocks, i.e., human-made or natural hazards. To enhance the resiliency of the infrastructure systems, network positions or credentials of infrastructure components (e.g., roads, bridges) based on their topology or connectivity need to be assessed. The empirical literature does not provide specific guidance how such topological credentials may contribute to system resilience, i.e., reducing overall adverse impacts as well as recovering from loss of performance. This study emphasized a coordinated and extensive network of experiments at different geographic scales by applying complex network principles to explore the resiliency of Florida road networks. Geographic modeling was used along with Florida road (with bridges) network data to perform network experiments and prioritize certain bridges based on their network credentials. In particular, the study established a systematic approach to rank the topological credentials of bridges based on the connectivity and attributes (i.e., weights) of road networks. Such credentials change significantly when different weights (i.e., vehicular traffic) are introduced to the network topology at different geographic scales. The practical implications for transportation network resilience as well as the scaling effects are examined by quantifying resilience in terms of average network travel time and developing recovery schemes of bridges for a sample road network. The study developed a credible methodology that would benefit states, municipalities, and other transportation authorities to prioritize risk-based recovery strategies.

This is mainly due to the fact that such a spatially distributed network is subjected to a variety of natural hazards and environmental stressors while it consists of a range of components with different ages. Among various components of a transportation network, bridges are known to be the most important but vulnerable components. Previous efforts to investigate the functionality of transportation networks, especially after earthquake events, have proven that damage to highway bridges may directly cause a major degradation in the functionality of the entire network. Considering the extensive socioeconomic consequences of network disruptions, the main focus of the current study is on the seismic resilience assessment of highway bridge networks exposed to deterioration processes. While this study provides a comprehensive computational framework to include several sources of uncertainty that must be taken into account to estimate the level of seismic risk, a special effort has been made to examine the effect of aging mechanisms on the obtained resilience measures. This new aspect provides more realistic estimates of the postevent functionality of transportation networks and can be immediately employed to identify appropriate restoration strategies.

Common themes for transportation system resilience include preparedness, robustness, response, and recovery. Adaptation is increasingly considered an important resilience ability for deeply uncertain conditions, and transformation an essential ability for sustainability. This paper discusses three factors that contribute to the development of resilience adaptively: (1) development of adaptive capabilities in an organization and its infrastructure systems to face known and unknown threats; (2) application of dynamic, adaptive, and robustness approaches in deeply uncertain conditions; and (3) mitigation of factors that cause or exacerbate unwanted disruptions to system function and performance—together with risk-based approaches to manage specific threats with well-understood likelihoods and consequences of occurrence. These factors enable an entity to adapt under deeply uncertain conditions—developing resilience as conditions change—and to adapt to curb the causes of disruptions. The benefits of developing resilience adaptively are to: enable the development of both threats-based and opportunities-based resilience; address deep uncertainties where it is impossible to quantify the chances and consequences of disruptions; and transition from merely managing symptoms to addressing the factors that cause, influence, or perpetuate them. These concepts are applied to develop an adaptive resilience improvement process for transportation agencies. This paper is potentially useful to practitioners interested in developing resilience adaptively and to researchers interested in risk-, adaptive and mitigation-based approaches to address known and unknown threats, for short- and long-term resilience gains.","2024-04","2024-12-01 14:26:04","2024-12-01 14:26:04","2024-12-01 14:26:04","835-848","","4","2678","","Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\QAG3PNFB\Amekudzi-Kennedy et al. - 2024 - Developing Transportation Resilience Adaptively to.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper first reviews the literature on the resilience of the transportation system to characterize the nature of approaches to the development of resilience in the transportation system. The paper offers examples of cases that provide evidence of the added benefits associated with a move from a largely technical approach to a sociotechnical approach. Subsequently, the paper reviews the literature on resilience in social, ecological, and economic systems to identify opportunities for expanding the scope of existing approaches to develop resilience in the transportation system and offer operational pathways forward. The review findings indicate that the following concepts may be applied to enhance the development of resilience in the transportation system: adaptive behavior and multiple equilibrium states from resilience in ecological systems; vulnerability, adaptive capacity, and participative capacity from resilience in social systems; a multiscale approach to resilience; and static and dynamic resilience in economic systems.

To accurately assess the impact of unexpected events on the operation of bus networks and scientiﬁcally evaluate their resilience, this paper proposes a framework for analyzing the resilience of bus networks. With the aim of providing scientiﬁc evidence to enhance the reliability of public transportation networks, this framework can be used to determine the resilience of bus networks to unexpected events. The main contributions of this framework include three aspects: 1. Construction of the CRITIC–entropy weighting model for screening and calculating key indicators of the resilience of the bus network; 2. Use of resilience cycle theory to construct a model for analyzing the resilience of bus routes, and design a set of resilience quantiﬁcation factors to calculate the resilience of bus routes; 3. Use of complex network theory to construct a model for analyzing the resilience of the bus network, by taking the bus route resilience obtained in the second step as the edge weight to calculate the resilience of the bus network. This paper takes the Beijing public transit system as an example and uses real data to verify the accuracy, scientiﬁcity, and feasibility of the proposed framework for analyzing the resilience of public transit networks to sudden events.

A novel framework for evaluating city-scale traffic performance under a secondary seismic hazard, liquefaction, is developed. At the core of this framework is a rapid regional liquefaction estimation method, where liquefaction hazard is first evaluated based on geotechnical in situ testing data at specific sites and then mapped through the whole region using random field models, which preserves the spatial dependence of soil properties yet allows accounting for uncertainties and variabilities within the studied region. The liquefaction hazard is quantified by the lateral deformation manifested at the ground surface, which is fed into the traffic network, causing disruptions on roads. The performance of the transportation network is simulated utilizing an agent-based modeling (ABM) method. The proposed framework is demonstrated in an example application. By comparing with existing knowledge and observations, it is found that the framework is capable of identifying liquefaction zones and modeling city-scale transportation performance.

Both human and machines are sources of system reliability and causes of accident occurrences. Considering the human behaviour contribution to HMS resilience, resilience can only be diagnosed if the human actions improve the system performances and help to recover from instability. Therefore, system resilience is the ability for a HMS to ensure performances and system stability whatever the context, i.e. after the occurrence of regular, unexpected or unprecedented disturbances. The COR&GEST platform is a railway simulation platform developed in the LAMIH in Valenciennes which involves a miniature railway structure. In order to study the human behaviour during the train driving activities with or without any technical failure occurrences, an experimental protocol was built with several inexperienced human operators. In railway transportation systems, traffic safety is the main performance criterion to take into account. Based on this criterion, authors propose to evaluate an instantaneous resilience indicator in order to assess the “local resilience” of HMS. As others performance criteria must be aggregated to reflect the whole studied HMS performance, the “global resilience” of HMS will be defined.","2011","2024-12-01 14:26:52","2024-12-01 14:26:53","2024-12-01 14:26:52","335-341","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Milan","Milano","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1007/978-88-470-1821-1_36","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\WDCTHGBF\Enjalbert et al. - 2011 - Assessment of Transportation System Resilience.pdf","","","","Cacciabue, P.

The resilience of a maritime transport network denotes the ability of the system to withstand damage and remain operational after disturbances, representing the invulnerability of the network and its ability to recover from harm. In this study, we built a crude oil transportation network titled the Maritime Silk Road using Automatic Identiﬁcation System (AIS) sensor data, designed a resilience assessment framework based on complex network theory, and assessed the resilience of the maritime crude oil transportation network from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives with the help of complex network metrics and a resilience model. The results show that the topology of the crude oil transportation network has a signiﬁcant impact on its resilience, in that network density and centrality are negatively related to network resilience, whereas network connectivity and size are positively related to resilience. Subsequently, the resilience of crude oil transportation networks declines at a steady rate under random attacks but declines sharply under intentional attacks. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of invulnerability and recovery in the context of resilience concludes that strengthening small and medium-sized ports in the network is important to enhance network resilience. These results can provide reference and decision support for port planning, route design, optimization, and form a foundation for a more secure and reliable maritime transportation network system.","2020","2024-12-01 14:26:57","2024-12-01 14:26:57","2024-12-01 14:26:57","181311-181325","","","8","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\TLM4AYRU\Mou et al. - 2020 - Assessment of the Resilience of a Complex Network .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Resilience can be incorporated into smart mobility systems to create a robust, integrated and intelligent transport system. Therefore, this study sought to determine resilience factors required for a resilient smart mobility system in emerging economies. The study used interpretive structural modelling (ISM) to establish the causal interrelationships among the factors drawing from data from experts in smart cities, city transport and academia. It was found that the most critical factor to drive resilience is foresight – the ability to anticipate disruptions. Three other resilience factor categories identified were dynamism, certainty and optimisation, which all point to the importance of building dynamic capabilities. The key implication for practice highlights the role that human and artificial intelligence can play in anticipating natural, social and infrastructure disruptions. ISM offered a mechanism to determine the critical causal resilience factors to be prioritised amongst the competing demands on the limited resources of emerging economies. Apart from foresight, which was found to be a driving factor, the other resilience factors are equally strong linkage factors (influence each other), thus further revealing the complexities that decisionmakers in urban cities of emerging economies constantly face.

However, cell treatment with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), which severely diminished subcellular ATP levels, abolished ER-to-Golgi transport. Interestingly, while 2-DG elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels and reduced long-distance movements of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-positive vesicles, robust short-term ER Ca2+ mobilizations, which strongly aﬀected the motility of these vesicles, did not considerably impair ER-to-Golgi transport.

Constructing a highly resilient URT network has practical significance for enhancing its capability to respond to disturbances. In this paper, models are developed to optimize a URT network’s structure with regard to resilience and to enhance the resilience of a disrupted URT network. A bi-level programming model that aims to maximize a URT network’s global accessibility and global efficiency is formulated to optimize the structure of the network. A novel repair strategy, called the simulation repair strategy, is proposed to enhance the resilience of a disrupted URT network by optimizing the repair sequence of failed stations. The models are utilized to enhance the resilience of the Chengdu subway network. The result indicates that the bi-level programming model guides the construction of new links to optimize the structure of the Chengdu subway network. Deliberate attacks are more harmful to the Chengdu subway network than random attacks. The network’s operators need to pay attention to the operations of critical stations (e.g., Chunxi Road station and Tianfu Square station) to prevent disturbances from exerting considerable negative effects on the network’s normal operations.

We present a comprehensive, multi-pronged framework that analyses information on network topology, spatial organization and passenger flow to understand the resilience of the London metro system. Topology of the London metro system is not fault tolerant in terms of maintaining connectivity at the periphery of the network since it does not exhibit small-world properties. The passenger strength distribution follows a power law, suggesting that while the London metro system is robust to random failures, it is vulnerable to disruptions on a few critical stations.

Problematic coastal soils are often weak in strength and stiffness and highly erodible, which causes distress to the pavements and arterial roads after flooding events. As a result, enhancement of the engineering properties of such weak soils is essential to provide resilient coastal infrastructure systems. A research study was designed to assess the efficacy of calciumbased stabilizers including lime and cement on the strength, stiffness, and erodibility characteristics of coastal soils. Laboratory studies were conducted on natural sandy and clayey soils as well as 7-day cured cement-treated sandy soil and 14-day cured lime-treated clayey soils to evaluate the improvements in resilient modulus, unconfined compressive strength, and erodibility. Specimens were also tested after soaking in the water bath for 6 and 24 h to replicate storm surge aftereffects. Test results indicated that the application of stabilizers significantly increased the strength and stiffness values for treated clayey and sandy soils. The treated clayey soils retained an average 150% higher strength after moisture conditioning and also recorded an average of 60% less degradation in the resilient moduli values as compared to untreated soils. Similar results were also observed for cement-treated sandy soils. The stabilized specimens also illustrated a reduction in the erodibility coefficient, from 0.1 to 0.02 cm3/N-s in lime-stabilized clay and 8 to 0.007 cm3/N-s in cement-stabilized sand. Consequently, the behavior of the natural soils changed from erodible or very erodible soils to resistant or very resistant soils after chemical stabilization. Overall, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of the efficacy of calcium-based stabilizers in improving the resiliency of transportation infrastructure, which could extend the service life and provide quick recovery from coastal hazards.","2024-02-22","2024-12-01 14:27:44","2024-12-01 14:27:45","2024-12-01 14:27:44","257-267","","","","","","","","","","","American Society of Civil Engineers","Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\AAMPS6IW\Chou et al. - 2024 - Stabilization of Coastal Soils to Improve Resilien.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Congress 2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study investigates vetiver and its broader application to transportation planning. Based on a literature review and interviews with experts, vetiver as a green infrastructure tool is summarized. An evaluation framework was devised in which the plant’s effectiveness to stabilize hillsides and manage stormwater is investigated. This framework is applied to a recent highway ﬂooding case where vetiver could have been used. While site-speciﬁc conditions and roadway requirements are critical to its effectiveness as a mitigation tool, additional pathways to understanding, acceptance, and use of vetiver to support transportation resilience requires convergence in engineering, design, and planning disciplines. Understanding barriers to the adoption of vetiver will also support efforts to increase other green infrastructure tools in transportation planning. Improvements in policies, standards, guidance and training and education on vetiver and green infrastructure will support the mitigation of transportation disruptions and community resilience.","2022-02-25","2024-12-01 14:27:53","2024-12-01 14:27:53","2024-12-01 14:27:53","147-164","","1","3","","CivilEng","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\6TI27CX9\Kim et al. - 2022 - Greening Roadway Infrastructure with Vetiver Grass.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes new indicators derived from the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) dynamics before and after a disruption to evaluate its impact on traffic resilience. Considering that MFD is an intrinsic property of a homogeneously congested transportation network, the resilience losses due to congestion and network disruption are measured separately. The resilience loss is defined as the reduction in trip completion rate, comparing congested cases to uncongested cases or disrupted cases to undisrupted cases. The resilience loss hence also exists for an undisrupted network and is measurable by the proposed method. A Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) model is calibrated by real origin-destination patterns, to allow for experiments in scenarios of different demand variations and supply disruptions. Case studies are conducted in Munich, Germany and Kyoto, Japan to test the usefulness of the newly proposed indicators. We furthermore explore the relationship between resilience loss and network topological attributes such as centrality and connectivity from a variety of synthetic disruption experiments in Munich and Kyoto. We find that the resilience loss in a grid-like network as in Kyoto is less dependent on the degradation of network connectivity than in a ring-like network as in Munich.","2024-07","2024-12-01 14:27:58","2024-12-01 14:27:58","2024-12-01 14:27:58","110095","","","247","","Reliability Engineering & System Safety","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\8H7GV8SE\Lu et al. - 2024 - Traffic resilience quantification based on macrosc.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

And yet, little attention has been paid to transportation cyber resilience. This paper thus proposes an investigation on this topic with a comprehensive literature review. The cyber components and plausible autonomous mobility systems (AMS) operation scenarios are discussed, before identifying possible cyber-attacks to AMS at both vehicle and system levels. The discussion then moves to existing practices to enhance cybersecurity, and a number of strategies are investigated toward enhancing AMS cyber resilience. At the vehicle level, creating layers and separation to reduce cyber component connectivity and deploying an independent procedure for data collection and processing are important in vehicle design and manufacturing. At the system level, recommended strategies include keeping redundancy in transportation capacity, maintaining a separate road network, and deploying different sub-autonomous mobility systems.","2021-12","2024-12-01 14:28:12","2024-12-01 14:28:12","2024-12-01 14:28:12","137-155","","3-4","14","","J Transp Secur","Cyber resilience of autonomous mobility systems","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\75ZT2XI3\Zou et al. - 2021 - Cyber resilience of autonomous mobility systems c.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neighborhood tabulation areas were used as the units of analysis. The recovery curve of each neighborhood tabulation area was modeled with the logistic function to quantify the resilience of road and subway systems. Moran's I tests confirmed the spatial correlation of recovery patterns for taxi and subway ridership. To account for this spatial correlation, citywide spatial models were estimated and found to outperform linear models. Factors such as the percentage of area influenced by storm surges, the distance to the coast, and the average elevation are found to affect the infrastructure resilience.

This method is applied to parameters of interest from Bureau of Transportation Statistics ﬂight data for the year 2012. The parameters are the total cancellations and average ﬂight delay across all airports. The expected values for these parameters is ﬁrst established for airports of interest on a given day of the week. The Mahalanobis distance for the network on a given day is then calculated based on these expected values and their variances. Periods with extreme distance values are deemed extreme events. We also separately estimate damages caused by various weather-related events using data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to verify results of the distance metric. The distance metric was able to capture impacts of major events like Hurricane Isaac, Hurricane Sandy, and the 2012 North American Blizzard. This method provides a quantitative approach for identifying events that signiﬁcantly impact the air transportation network. The method can thus support decision-making in designing a more resilient network or air trafﬁc control; for example, by evaluating alternative network topologies or producing training data for disruption impact prediction models.","2018-04","2024-12-01 14:28:26","2024-12-01 14:28:26","2024-12-01 14:28:26","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","Vancouver, BC","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\JVDQNSM5\Chandramouleeswaran and Tran - 2018 - Data-driven resilience quantification of the US Ai.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 Annual IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multiple failures can occur for many reasons, for example, natural disasters, epidemic outbreaks affecting software components, or intentional attacks. This article investigates new methods for lessening the impact of such failures in terms of the number of connections affected. Two heuristic-based link prioritization strategies for improving network resilience are proposed. One strategy is built upon the concept of betweenness centrality, while the second is based on what we call the observed link criticality. Both strategies are evaluated through simulation on a large synthetic topology that represents a GMPLS-based transport network.

The objective of this report is to develop a framework for calculating the measure of resilience (MOR) to disaster for intermodal transportation systems. TransCAD was used to model the intermodal network and generate transportation data for the MORs calculation procedure. Intermodal Origin-Destination (OD) traffic before and after disaster struck was estimated based on the study area’s population and employment data. The pre-disaster and post-disaster population and employment data will be collected at county level and disaggregated to each Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ) by using linear equations. A series of indicators in terms of mobility, accessibility, and reliability were selected to evaluate the intermodal system performance based on the TransCAD outputs. The report further introduced a Performance Index (PI) combining some indicators to measure the system performance regarding mobility. The Level of Service (LOS) of highway network and intermodal terminals before and after disaster was also determined according to the LOS standards. This report defined MORs as the percentage of system performance degradation due to a disaster. A formula was developed to give the intermodal system MOR a quantitative value with respect to mobility, accessibility, and reliability. The above process was reviewed in a case study along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed MOR calculation procedure.","","2024-12-01 14:28:47","2024-12-01 14:28:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\ZXYASF7H\Jin - Li Zhang, Ph.D., P.E.

For a proof of principle, a simple transport model based on the edge-betweenness and three abstract yet widely studied random network ensembles are considered here: Erd˝os-R´enyi random networks with ﬁnite connectivity, small world networks and spatial networks embedded in a two-dimensional plane. Using speciﬁc numerical large-deviation techniques, probability densities as small as 10−80 are obtained here. This allows to study typical but also the most and the least resilient networks. The resulting distributions fulﬁll the mathematical large-deviation principle, i.e., can be well described by rate functions in the thermodynamic limit. The analysis of the limiting rate function reveals that the resilience follows an exponential distribution almost everywhere. An analysis of the structure of the network shows that the most-resilient networks can be obtained, as a rule of thumb, by minimizing the diameter of a network. Also, trivially, by including more links a network can typically be made more resilient. On the other hand, the least-resilient networks are very rare and characterized by one (or few) small core(s) to which all other nodes are connected. In total, the spatial network ensemble turns out to be most suitable for obtaining and studying resilience of real mostly ﬁnite-dimensional networks. Studying this ensemble in combination with the presented large-deviation approach for more realistic, in particular dynamic transport networks appears to be very promising.","2014-05","2024-12-01 14:29:04","2024-12-01 14:29:04","2024-12-01 14:29:03","114","","5","87","","Eur.

First, the base model, which represents the status of a public transportation terminal, was created and validated using a system dynamics simulation approach. Then the impact of two penalty policies, including fixed penalty policy (FPP) and variable penalty policy (VPP) on the violations within the terminal was investigated. The simulation results show that the variable penalty policy significantly reduces the violations of passenger terminal drivers. Next, the extended model was developed which considered several terminals. Finally, by presenting two policies of fixed inspector assignment (FIA) and variable inspector assignment (VIA), the effect of four scenarios of combining inspection and penalties policies was investigated. The simulation results showed that combining the variable penalty and variable inspector assignment policies could significantly reduce terminal violations. Also, the implementation of this policy does not require an additional inspector.

In this study, the public transit systems in New Jersey based on their vulnerability, resilience, and efﬁciency during the recovery period following Hurricane Sandy were analyzed. Diverse trafﬁc, infrastructure, events, and web-based sources of Big Data are applied. Due to the sparsity of public transit performance measures for vulnerability, recovery, and resilience, various measures from existing literature were adapted for public transit. Following Hurricane Sandy, the bus transit network of NJ Transit (NJT) recovered much faster than its rail network. This was observed because the road infrastructure recovered much faster as compared to rail and subway networks. Additionally, the most critical link for the NJT buses remained intact during the hurricane whereas rail and subway systems suffered loss of power for driving and signaling. Performance measures such as critical links identiﬁcation, change in travel time, friability, and resilience triangles for speciﬁc bus routes on the NJT bus network were estimated. Transit agencies can use these measures and methodologies in planning and preparing for disasters to study route vulnerability and transit network resilience and standardize performance measures.","2019-09-03","2024-12-01 14:29:36","2024-12-01 14:29:36","2024-12-01 14:29:36","491-519","","5","11","","Journal of Transportation Safety & Security","Evaluating the resilience and recovery of public transit system using big data","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\4PRBDPTB\Mudigonda et al. - 2019 - Evaluating the resilience and recovery of public t.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A novel performance indicator based on the concept of the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) is developed to assess the travel production of the network. The proposed indicator is obtained by calculating the weighted space-mean ﬂow of an urban network, which is a proxy for the travel production of the corresponding network. The resilience of the road network is deﬁned as its ability to retain the same level of travel production after occurrence of a disruption. This paper shows how real-time trafﬁc control measures can enhance the resilience of the network. More speciﬁcally, the impact of re-routing as a real-time trafﬁc management measure is investigated in a network where a link is closed due to an unpredictable incident. The main advantage of this approach in comparison to the existing travel time based approaches is that it neither requires a detailed model of the network nor a calibration of a dynamic trafﬁc assignment model for different demand scenarios, as the MFD is a property of the network and is not sensitive to small changes in demand.","2018-11","2024-12-01 14:29:40","2024-12-01 14:29:41","2024-12-01 14:29:40","519-524","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","Maui, HI","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\GB4GIZNA\Amini et al. - 2018 - Evaluating the impact of real-time traffic control.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2014, about 851 million passengers and 39 billion pounds of freights were delivered by over 9.5 million ﬂights in the United States. As seen in Iceland volcano eruption in 2010, a deﬁciency of hub airports can bring a huge impact on the whole transport system and even on the world economy. So how the failure of individual node affects the overall network resilience is an important issue to study. Air transportation is known to be a scale-free network, which has few of hubs having high degree. So it is relatively robust against failure but vulnerable to targeted attack on a hub. There are numerous studies devoted to measure node vulnerability and evaluate network robustness; however, previous studies could not consider the node capacity for evaluating overall network performance. This study focuses on the network resilience, where the nodes are located in a real space and have a capacity to function. Using the data from Federal Aviation Administration, the simulation demonstrates and evaluates the resilience of the US air transportation network. This study proposes the indices of adaptative capacity for quantifying network resilience, which represent the ability of a network to replace an attacked node by other adjacent nodes. The simulation has two parts to measure the adaptive capacity of networks: under a single attack and a sustained attack. The results identify the susceptible nodes degrading the adaptive capacity of the network and evaluate each sub-network’s resilience in case of cascading node failures. Therefore, this study can help us to diagnose the vulnerable node and contribute the plan for improvement of network resilience.","2016-05-27","2024-12-01 14:29:45","2024-12-01 14:29:45","2024-12-01 14:29:45","38-49","","sup1","20","","International Journal of Urban Sciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\NZPPKX99\Yoo and Yeo - 2016 - Evaluation of the resilience of air transportation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As an important lifeline of the city, transportation infrastructure is an important part of improving urban resilience. Studying the coordinated development degree of urban resilience and transportation infrastructure level is related to the future development of the city. On the basis of measuring the urban resilience and transportation infrastructure level in the Yangtze River Delta, this study uses the coupling coordination model and spatial autocorrelation model to explore the spatiotemporal evolution trend of the coupling coordination between urban resilience and transportation infrastructure level. The results show that ﬁrst, the average development levels of urban resilience and transportation infrastructure are at the middle and lower levels, showing a spatial pattern of “high in the southeast and low in the northwest.” Second, the degree of coupling coordination ﬂuctuates and rises and is in the transition stage from mild imbalance to primary coordination. Finally, the degree of coupling coordination is spatially positively autocorrelated, and the degree of agglomeration shows a stable development trend, but the difference of coordinated agglomeration between cities is expanding. To enhance the security and sustainable competitiveness of the Yangtze River Delta, this study argues that it is urgent to establish the concept of resilient urban development and promote the integration of urban agglomeration transportation infrastructure to promote the coordinated development of urban safety systems and infrastructure.

There are three improvements to weather and climate resilience, namely, (a) the creation of Centre of Operations Rio (Centro de Operações Rio; COR) to co-ordinate daily operations and disaster response, (b) a series of innovations in operational integration enabled by co-locating services within COR and (c) infrastructure investment prior to the Olympic Games, which increased transport provision. The results highlight the need for integration and leadership across the private transport sector and demonstrate how resilience to current weather and future climate is intrinsically linked to sustainable urban mobility and should be considered in state and municipal planning strategies for housing, public services, and commercial and industrial development.

The framework comprises original concepts, a mathematical approach, and an algorithm. Statistical treatment based on the original framework concepts supports short, middle, or long-term decision-making settings.

The mitigating actions such as delaying, canceling, and rerouting affected flights aim at maintaining both the network’s resilience and safety at the acceptable level under given conditions. It is of great significance to understand and quantify resilience in the complex socio-technical air transport network, which has attracted extensive attentions.

The Granger causality test is adopted to evaluate the causality relationship between different elements of a complex system. We construct the hourly delay propagation networks and analyze the resilience of the air transport system through the evolution of delay propagation networks. The useful measurement metric of resilience is proposed, and evolution patterns of generation and recovery of flight delays are also investigated.

Bridges act as bottlenecks within road and rail networks, since bridges are crunch points along the network system. Their failures due to multiple natural hazards (e.g. floods, earthquakes, tsunami or ground movements) may cause disproportionate losses, which are expected to be exacerbated due to climate change. Thus, pinpointing the vulnerabilities and quantifying bridge resilience within transportation networks is of paramount importance in the context of natural hazards. However, reliable quantification of risk and resilience of bridges is not yet available, as engineering judgment dominates quantitative assessments. This paper describes an integrated framework for the development of numerical fragility functions and the resilience assessment of bridges subjected to multiple hazards. The framework is applied to obtain the fragility of a representative bridge exposed to flood-induced scour followed by an earthquake. The resulting fragility functions are essential to evaluate direct losses due to multiple hazards, i.e. physical damage, as a means to deliver the Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) of the exposed bridges and networks. The framework is extended to the transport network level exposed to multiple hazards, providing a mean for allocating the resources reasonably toward efficient management and consequence analysis.","","2024-12-01 14:30:10","2024-12-01 14:30:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\AE935IN5\Yuan et al. - FRAGILITY OF BRIDGES EXPOSED TO MULTIPLE HAZARDS A.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, a set of disrupted situations retrieved from the study dataset is analyzed to quantify the impact on network operations. Results demonstrate the ability of the proposed metrics to capture traffic dynamics as well as their utility for quantifying the resilience of the network. The proposed methodology combines different metrics from the complex networks theory (i.e., heterogeneity, density, and symmetry) computed on temporal and weighted graphs.

Methodology: This paper conducts a Systematic Literature Review using the keywords ""Supply Chain Resilience"" combined with ""Transport/Infrastructure networks"" to identify the relationship between transport networks and Supply Chain Resilience. The method, as a result, identifies about 251 articles from 2004 to 2022, of which 36 relevant papers are included. Findings: Excluded overview papers address Supply Chain Resilience and transport independently. As a result of the full-text screening, a shift to quantitative methods can be observed.

Instead of just focusing on the transport sector, the authors propose an integrated approach to housing and mobility. This approach acknowledges the challenges posed by inadequate housing and depen­ dence on motorised transport during the COVID-19 crisis. In contrast, adequate housing and cycling became paramount resources while confronting the pandemic. Using Santiago de Chile as a case study, this research examines how different relocation scenarios for its current housing deficit cannot only affect the ability to implement stay-at-home measures, but also the potential of cycling as a relevant commuting alternative. The current location of the families suffering this deficit is compared to three scenarios: compact, pericentral and extended. In light of the learnings from the COVID-19 crisis, a housing-cycling policy becomes a tool for resil­ ience; equity is achieved by enforcing the right to housing, by increasing job opportunities among the poor, and by reducing the dependence on expensive motorised transport; decarbonisation is achieved by promoting active transportation and reducing the dependence on motorisation.","2021-08","2024-12-01 14:31:03","2024-12-01 14:31:03","2024-12-01 14:31:03","48-60","","","109","","Transport Policy","Housing and accessibility after the COVID-19 pandemic","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\JPZWHQFR\Valenzuela-Levi et al. - 2021 - Housing and accessibility after the COVID-19 pande.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regional road networks are often uncongested and have sparse and long-spanning link densities. Consequently, they are more impacted by natural disasters and thereby by potential road closures that may be imposed afterwards. Information about road closures after disruptive events can be transmitted through roadside information dissemination methods such as variable message signs, Cooperative-Intelligent Transport Systems or highway advisory radio. This paper proposes an optimisation model to find optimal location of roadside guidance devices across a regional road network for improving total travel time (TTT) within the network. To achieve this, firstly, a network design model is formulated using a bi-level framework and implemented to find the optimal locations of roadside guidance devices that lead to reducing the TTT of a disrupted network. Secondly, two methods for solving the formulated problem are presented, an exact solution method called SO-relaxation that cuts the solution space using system optimum traffic assignment. The other method is a hybrid-GA that is a heuristic solution method. Results show that locating guidance devices optimally in a disrupted network leads to a more resilient road network in which the post-disaster TTT of the network during recovery phase is less than when no action is taken. It is also shown that the improvement achieved by roadside guidance is a function of available resources and the road users willingness to obey the guidance provided.","2017-10-21","2024-12-01 14:31:37","2024-12-01 14:31:38","2024-12-01 14:31:37","794-828","","9","13","","Transportmetrica A: Transport Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\HKLAWNKB\Kaviani et al. - 2017 - Improving regional road network resilience by opti.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, any violation of its functioning by cyber attacks automatically inﬂuences the safety of people and automotive engineering on the road. The purpose of this article is to provide an analytical overview of cyber attacks on VANET/ITS, presented in state-of-the-art publications on this topic by the prediction of its cyber resistance. We start with an analysis of the top 10 cyber threats, considered according to the following schemes: attack mechanism, vulnerability, damage, object of attack, and a counter measure. We then set out a synergistic approach for assessing the cyber resistance of the forward-looking VANET/ITS conceptual model, formed by the merger of the internet of vehicles and software-deﬁned networking technology. Finally, we identify open issues and associated research opportunities, the main ones being the formalization of threats, vulnerability stratiﬁcation, the choice of the level of network management centralization and, last but not least, the modeling and prediction of VANET/ITS cyber resistance.","2019-01-14","2024-12-01 14:31:42","2024-12-01 14:31:43","2024-12-01 14:31:42","27","","1","10","","Information","Forecasting Issues of Wireless Communication Networks’ Cyber Resilience for An Intelligent Transportation System","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\INUXCMKP\Buinevich and Vladyko - 2019 - Forecasting Issues of Wireless Communication Netwo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data obtained from case studies of two recent natural disasters in the U.S. are utilized to explore the status quo, key players and interactions, and the drivers to and barriers of improving resilience in transportation infrastructure systems. The ﬁndings indicate that strategies for enhancing resilience in transportation infrastructure systems include redistributing the available funding through a special funding vehicle, using resilience-based performance measures, and integrating the efforts of different stakeholders. The SoS approach along with the ﬁndings from the case studies provides an analytical tool for understanding the dynamics of resilience in infrastructure systems. Such understanding could lead to identifying strategies for enhancing resilience in infrastructure systems. The study presented in this paper provides new insights to identify the determinants of resilience in highway transportation infrastructure based on a SoS approach.","2017-12-10","2024-12-01 14:31:47","2024-12-01 14:31:47","2024-12-01 14:31:47","22","","4","2","","Infrastructures","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\P8WG4USY\Mostafavi - 2017 - A System-of-Systems Approach for Integrated Resili.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we analyze the vulnerability of the German railway network to four types of natural hazards that regularly cause disruptions in German rail operations: ﬂoods, mass movements, slope ﬁres, and tree falls. Using daily train trafﬁc data matched with various data on disruptive events, we quantify the extent to which these four types of natural hazard reduce daily train trafﬁc volumes. With a negative binomial count data regression, we ﬁnd evidence that the track segments of the German railway network are most vulnerable to ﬂoods, followed by mass movements and tree-fall events. On average, ﬂoods reduce trafﬁc on track segments by 19% of the average daily train trafﬁc, mass movements by 16%, and tree fall by 4%. Moreover, when more than one type of natural hazard affects the track segment on the same day, train trafﬁc on that segment falls by 34% of the average train trafﬁc. Slope ﬁres have an ambiguous and nonrobust effect on train trafﬁc due to the reverse causality due to its triggering factors. This is the ﬁrst study that attempts to rank different natural hazards according to their impact on railway trafﬁc. The results have implications for the selection of resilience strategy and can help prioritize policy measures.","2021-12-08","2024-12-01 14:31:51","2024-12-01 14:31:52","2024-12-01 14:31:51","174","","12","6","","Infrastructures","Resilience of Railway Transport to Four Types of Natural Hazards","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\4I4244Q9\Fabella and Szymczak - 2021 - Resilience of Railway Transport to Four Types of N.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

TIs, part of critical infrastructures (CIs), are highly correlated with urban disaster management in terms of their resilience when cities are facing a crisis or disaster. According to many studies, indicator assessment has been frequently used for the resilience management of CIs in recent decades. Deﬁning and characterizing indicators can be useful for disaster managers as it could help monitor and improve the capacities and performance of TIs. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is (1) to identify and summarize the existing indicators of TIs resilience from the currently available literature, and (2) to discuss the possible future studies of the resilience indicator of TIs. The ﬁrst results indicated that there are some barriers to identify indicators following the common search method through keywords. Additionally, the indicators found are mainly related to technical information, the disruption stage, and internal TIs.

The goal of this study is to develop a list of strategies to enhance the resilience of the transportation infrastructure and to provide recommendations for implementing them. To this end, a comprehensive review of the existing literature was performed, and a list of potential factors that have impact over transportation infrastructure was prepared. Based on the outcome of the literature review, a survey was developed and distributed to experts in the field of transportation infrastructure. Ninety-two survey responses were collected and analyzed, and based on the analysis, resilience enhancement strategies for transportation infrastructure were developed. The findings of this paper demonstrate that maintaining an optimum number of nodes in the network to ensure the easy and efficient rerouting of traffic from a damaged link or node enhances resilience significantly. Incorporating optional routes at the beginning of a new project or for a roadway expansion will also eventually increase the resilience of the network.

In a safety context, the term “dragons” originates from Professor David Woods at Ohio State University and the relatively new field of Resilience Engineering. Dragons are an illustration for the consequence of “surprise” as depicted in ancient seafarer maps that filled the seas beyond the known boundaries of the ancient world with fire-breathing dragons, and certain death. In a modern day sense, dragons represent the unintended, and often unforeseen and unpredictable, consequences of crossing operational boundaries that are difficult to identify precisely, are often influenced by various actors, and are continually changing. In particular, due to the complex, dynamic-adaptive behaviour of systems, classic statistical metrics used in current Safety Management Systems (SMS) no longer allow us to predict the next undesired event. We need to change our focus and find new ways of capturing the faint signals of impending failure. This will require structural, psychological and social changes in the way SMSs work. In this paper, I will address the issues of understanding and managing complex, dynamic-adaptive systems through the quality of resilience, and how to avoid “jousting with dragons” in the transport sector using a Resilience Engineering lens.","2017-08-07","2024-12-01 14:32:10","2024-12-01 14:32:11","2024-12-01 14:32:10","","","","","","","Jousting with Dragons","","","","","","","en","","International Transport Forum Discussion Papers","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Series: International Transport Forum Discussion Papers Volume: 2017/19 DOI: 10.1787/72ecda07-en","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\ADBTMCQA\2017 - Jousting with Dragons A resilience engineering ap.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017/19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We focus on demand disruptions with particular attention to the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand shocks can occur due to special events or various forms of societal upheaval and crises. We classify demand shocks along two dimensions: whether demand increases or decreases, and the time frame of the event. Data from Sweden are used to illustrate the impacts in the rail transport system of COVID-19, which provides a prime example of a long-term negative demand shock. The chapter finally identifies demand cut mitigation, supply responsiveness and tenacity as three approaches to increasing the resilience to demand losses.","","2024-12-01 14:32:13","2024-12-01 14:32:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\IV85KAZS\Jenelius - Rail Transport Resilience to Demand Shocks and COV.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pedestrian path discrimination automation applies convolutional neural networks and ‘you only look once’ analysis to identify the road surface conditions of walkways and the presence of obstacles. Quantitative analyses for the safety and economic problems associated with transportation vulnerabilities through discrimination algorithms using deep image learning were carried out.

Eﬀorts to decrease the vulnerability of transport networks have been largely limited to understanding projected risks through governance and administrative eﬀorts. Where physical adaptation measures have been implemented, these have typically aligned with a traditional “engineering resilience” approach of increasing the strength and rigidity of assets to withstand the impacts of climate change and maintain a stable operating state. Such systems have limited agility and are susceptible to failure from “surprise events”. Addressing these limitations, this paper considers an alternate approach to resilience, inspired by natural ecosystems that sense conditions in real-time, embrace multi-functionality and evolve in response to changing environmental conditions. Such systems embrace and thrive on unpredictability and instability. This paper synthesises key literature in climate adaptation and socio-ecological resilience theory to propose a shift in paradigm for transport infrastructure design, construction and operation, towards engineered systems that can transform, evolve and internally manage vulnerability. The authors discuss the opportunity for biomimicry (innovation inspired by nature) as an enabling discipline for supporting resilient and regenerative infrastructure, introducing three potential tools and frameworks. The authors conclude the importance of leveraging socio-ecological resilience theory, building on the achievements in engineering resilience over the past century.

In the resilience assessment framework, system performance is chosen as the key proxy for resilience, which is measured based on a service performance index. Subsequently, a failure model is designed to determine the service performance loss of a streamline network following a disturbance. To obtain maximum service performance, we propose a restoration model that integrates an optimal recovery sequencing strategy and a load redistribution strategy. A test example is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.

However, a widely accepted definition of the resilience of the transportation system and a structure for its measurement are not available. This paper provides a literature review that summarizes the metrics used to assess the resilience of the transportation system and a categorization of the assessment approaches at three levels of analysis (the asset, network, and systems levels). Furthermore, this paper ties these metrics to relevant dimensions of community resilience.

The COVID-19 pandemic induced environment presents a divide between the “new and old normal” with policy and planning implications for health, transport and general socio-economic growth and development. Multiple and complex nuanced transport matters cascade all geographic scales and pervade all sectors of the economy. The extent to which existing transport systems capacities are resilient, adaptive, and optimized for complete disaster planning, management and sustainability is questioned. This paper critically reviews how the COVID-19 pandemic has stretched the resilience and adaptive transport systems capacities in South Africa. A critical question interrogated is whether on-going policy and planning interventions constitute imperfect or perfect attempts at closing COVID -19 policy and planning emergent gaps. The paper makes use of South Africa as a case study, referencing the Disaster Management Act (No. 57 of 2002) and logical Disaster Management Act: Regulations relating to COVID-19 (Government Notice 318 of 2020),1 with specific reference to the transport sector lockdown regulations in unravelling policy and planning implications. Drawing from the complex systems adaptive theory (CSAT), sustainability theory (ST), innovation theory (IT), transitions theory (TT), thematic COVID -19 transport planning and policy adaptation, mitigation measures in the South African transportation sector are discussed. Emergent lessons with respect to developing and advancing a new generation of resilient, adaptive, and optimized transport proof infrastructure and services including revising transport and related policies that navigates through various waves and cycles of induced pandemic and shocks is suggested.","2022-09","2024-12-01 14:33:02","2024-12-01 14:33:03","2024-12-01 14:33:02","127-150","","","125","","Transport Policy","Stretching resilience and adaptive transport systems capacity in South Africa","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\7WD3JBX8\Chakwizira - 2022 - Stretching resilience and adaptive transport syste.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For situational awareness and decision support, datadriven analytics about serviceability are invaluable to metro agencies and decision-makers of cities. This paper presents a data-driven analytical framework that quantitatively evaluates COVID-19-caused resilience performance of metro rails. Several characteristics (e.g., vulnerability, robustness, rapidity, and degree to return) of the metro system’s responses to the disturbance were identified and modeled with multivariate multiple regression. The applicability and rationality of the resilience evaluation model were validated by the metro transit data of the United States. The preliminary results disclosed that metro rail transit encountered more vulnerability (90.6%) in passenger trips than motorbus and light rail (around 70%). A set of statistical models were employed to disentangle the effect of socio-demographic variables and COVID-19-related factors on the metro transit. The disclosed emerging knowledge of resilience provides an in-depth understanding of mobility trends for the public and time-sensitive decision support for the policy effects, to further improve the service and management of the metro system under the spread of the epidemic.","2023-02","2024-12-01 14:33:07","2024-12-01 14:33:07","2024-12-01 14:33:07","104315","","","89","","Sustainable Cities and Society","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\3QMLLZC2\Zhang et al. - 2023 - Quantitative resilience assessment of the network-.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An approach based on emergency levels, quantiﬁed as the number of damaged lanes, is designed to evaluate the resilience of transportation systems. A genetic algorithm is used to identify the worst combination of damaged lanes under each emergency level. In maximizing the resilience, we use the integrated reconﬁguration of both trafﬁc supply and demand as the optimal recovery solution, which reduces trafﬁc demand through a combination of different trafﬁc modes and increases trafﬁc capacity through a contraﬂow technique. The numerical results show that the proposed model can identify the maximum damage a system can resist and can determine the optimal recovery solution.

This study identified existing workforce issues and recruitment and retention practices by state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and compared rural and urban transportation employee outlooks. Results indicated that the primary incentives for current DOT employees to consider private-sector employment are better salary and promotional opportunities. Additionally, rural DOT regions have a more difficult time recruiting and retaining employees, and rural DOT employees feel that DOTs are not fully aware of their needs.

This work adds to this notion of resilience by explicitly considering that only limited resources will be available to support recovery activities, and their simultaneous implementation assumed in the prior work may not be possible. That is, the order in which recovery actions are taken can greatly affect gains achieved in capacity recovery over time. By developing an optimal schedule for a set of chosen recovery actions for each potential disaster scenario, the proposed model provides a more accurate depiction of the system’s resilience to disaster. Two solution methods are presented, both employing a decomposition approach that eliminates the need for recursive computations.

Loss of bridge functionality has consequences on entire transport networks, which are also interconnected with other networks. Cascading events then unfold in the entire system of systems, leading to significant economic losses and societal disruption to business and society. Recent natural disasters have revealed the vulnerabilities of bridges and critical assets to diverse hazards (e.g. floods, blasts, earthquakes), some of which are exacerbated due to climate change. The assessment of bridge and network vulnerabilities by quantifying their capacity and functionality loss and adaptation to new requirements and stressors is thus of paramount importance. The aim of this work was try to understand the main compound hazards, stressors and threats that have short- and long-term impacts on the structural capacity and functionality of bridges and the impact of bridge closures on network operability. The main drivers of bridge restoration and reinstatement were also considered. Loss of performance, driven by redundancy and robustness of a bridge, is the first step to be considered in the overall process of resilience quantification.

Digital technologies have the potential to provide rapid resilience assessments in a quantifiable and engineered manner for transport infrastructure, which is exposed to multiple natural and human-induced hazards and diverse loads throughout their life-cycle. Physical damage and disruption of networks and interdependent systems may cause tremendous socioeconomic impact, affecting world economies and societies. Nowadays, transport infrastructure stakeholders have shifted the requirements in risk and resilience assessment. The expectation is that risk is estimated efficiently, almost in real-time with high accuracy, aiming at maximising the functionality and minimising losses. Nevertheless, no integrated framework exists for quantifying resilience to diverse hazards, based on structural and functionality monitoring (SHFM) data, and this is the main capability gap that this paper envisages filling. Monitoring systems have been used widely in transport infrastructure and have been studied extensively in the literature. Data can facilitate prognosis of the asset condition and the functionality of the network, informing computer-based asset and traffic models, which can assist in defining actionable performance indicators, for diagnosis and for defining risk and loss expediently and accurately. Evidence exists that SHFM is an enabler of resilience. However, strategies are absent in support of monitoring-based resilience assessment in transport infrastructure management. In response to the above challenge, this paper puts forward for the first time in the international literature, a roadmap for monitoring-based quantification of resilience for transport infrastructure, based on a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art. It is a holistic asset management roadmap, which identifies the interactions among the design, monitoring, risk assessment and quantification of resilience to multiple hazards. Monitoring is embraced as a vital component, providing expedient feedback for recovery measures, accelerating decision-making for adaptation of changing ecosystems and built environments, utilising emerging technologies, to continuously deliver safer and resilient transport infrastructure.","2020-12","2024-12-01 14:34:48","2024-12-01 14:34:48","2024-12-01 14:34:48","141001","","","746","","Science of The Total Environment","Monitoring of transport infrastructure exposed to multiple hazards","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\SZZ76SI7\Achillopoulou et al. - 2020 - Monitoring of transport infrastructure exposed to .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Terminals and ports are critical components of these systems. These components however, are, by the nature of their design inherently vulnerable to natural and terrorist attack, and evidence is mounting that an attack on or involving the IM freight transport system and its components would have catastrophic consequences. Significant effort has been expended on the development of technologies and other measures that can aid in addressing these security needs at ports in the United States and abroad. A quantitative measure, termed resilience, is employed to determine the best set of actions to improve security at nodal facilities in an IM network. Resilience accounts for both the innate reliability of a facility and the ability of short-term recovery actions to mitigate negative effects. This concept has been employed at the system level. A framework for its application at the IM component level is proposed. A case-based analysis is conducted to produce the specific steps required to apply this concept to an existing port. The framework is general and can be applied to any IM nodal component, such as terminals, marshalling yards, and border control stations. The resulting ability to quantify the component's level of vulnerability will aid decision makers in assessing trade-offs between investment and costly security implementations.","2010-01","2024-12-01 14:34:56","2024-12-01 14:34:57","2024-12-01 14:34:56","54-65","","1","2166","","Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board","","","","","","","","en","https://journals.sagepub.com/page/policies/text-and-data-mining-license","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\SE3GW7T9\Nair et al. - 2010 - Resilience Framework for Ports and Other Intermoda.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, multiple studies have been being conducted to develop a resilient system reducing the negative consequences of disruption and decreasing the reconstruction time after the disaster. In this regard, most studies have focused on limited number of resilience dimensions and have not investigated all aspects of resilience characteristics for transportation infrastructure. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a comprehensive conceptual model determining the relationships of resilience dimensions in critical and interdependent transportation infrastructure. To achieve the objectives of the study, more than hundred and fifty related scholarly articles were scrutinized thoroughly. Eighteen dimensions of resilience including robustness, redundancy, and resourcefulness were identified. It was found that the resilience dimensions have strong relationship with reconstruction timeline due to natural disasters. In addition, it was concluded that adaptability, which is the ability to learn from disastrous event to resist the next event more effectively, has a positive correlation with preparedness prior to the disruption and robustness of the system. In the end, a conceptual model was developed and proposed to determine the phases related to the identified resilience dimensions as well as their relationships with each other in transportation systems. The developed model provides the foundation to measure resilience of critical transportation systems and networks in different cities and counties. This study will also significantly help decision-makers and departments of transportations to prioritize their maintenance plans based on resilience of their transportation infrastructure and adopt appropriate proactive strategies to reduce unintended consequences of disruptive events.","2020-11-09","2024-12-01 14:35:08","2024-12-01 14:35:08","2024-12-01 14:35:07","644-653","","","","","","","","","","","American Society of Civil Engineers","Tempe, Arizona","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\CRDKL297\Nipa and Kermanshachi - 2020 - Identification of the Resilience Dimensions and De.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Construction Research Congress 2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the results of this phenomenon is that vital transport networks are increasingly exposed to disruption or disablement, leading to important societal risk. In this present-day context, tools and guidelines to enhance the security of infrastructure networks under extreme climatological hazards become necessary. With this aim, this paper presents an innovative probabilistic framework to estimate the resilience of a traffic network impacted by extreme weather events. The proposed methodology takes into account important aspects such as the cost increment, the user stress level, and the system impedance to alter its previous state. Moreover, the uncertainty involved in the variables (1) traffic demand; (2) local vulnerability to a given hazard; and (3) capacity of response of users is considered. Probabilistic curves of the system response are defined using the Monte Carlo method and Latin hypercube sampling. There are multiple benefits to using this novel framework because it will allow early warning response, will support the decision-making process, and will permit the improvement of existing networks and the generation of more efficient designs.

Furthermore, to analyze the effects of intermodal connections on the resilience of the air network, a second layer representing a hypothetical bus network is added to the model and studied. We use these models, supported by publicly available data, to identify routes likely to be attacked by intelligent adversaries and those critical to the resilient operation of the air network in such scenarios.

The proposed method could obtain a set of general optimal restoration schedules in an efficient manner, so that decision-makers could make a final choice by weighting other preferences and experience. In the methodology, a new travel speed-based metric is introduced for performance assessment of transportation network, and three normalised independent indicators are developed to characterise network resilience from the perspective of functionality curve.

However, existing studies have yet to examine the climate impacts on transportation networks systematically rather than indepen­ dently assessing the infrastructures at a component level. Therefore, it is crucial to configure alternative shipping routes from a systematic perspec­ tive to reduce climate vulnerabilities and optimise the resilience of the whole shipping network. This paper aims to assess the global shipping network focusing on climate resilience by a methodology that combines climate risk indicators, centrality analysis and ship routing optimisation. The methodology is designed for overviewing the climate vulnerability of the current and future scenarios for comparison. First, a multi-centrality assessment defines the global shipping hubs and network vulnerabilities. Secondly, a shipping model is built for finding the optimal shipping route between ports, considering the port disruption days caused by climate change (e.g. extreme weather) based on the climate vulnerability analysis result from the first step. It contributes to a new framework combining the global and local seaport climate vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it recom­ mends changing shipping routes by a foreseeable increase in port disrup­ tions caused by extreme weather for climate adaptation.","2024-01-02","2024-12-01 14:35:31","2024-12-01 14:35:32","2024-12-01 14:35:31","15-34","","1","51","","Maritime Policy & Management","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\EZQN5D54\Poo and Yang - 2024 - Optimising the resilience of shipping networks to .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Disruptions in the networks were simulated by using link-based targeted and random strategies. With simulation results, network performance under disruption was assessed by using two metrics: global efficiency and the relative size of the giant component for each disruption strategy. The biological network exhibits superior resistance to disruption regardless of strategy, a quality attributed to its redundant and cyclic weblike network structure and its innate ability to adapt to disruptions by developing network structures that have been honed through millions of years of evolution.

This study uses a new framework, i.e. the combination of four key variables, namely health, safety, ergonomics, and resilience engineering to assess the performance of a railway transportation system. To this end, a questionnaire was first designed based on the stated concepts for data collection and performance evaluation of Tehran–Karaj railway electrification system. Then, data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach was used to evaluate the decision-making units (DMUs) of the railway system. The results indicated that there was a significant growth in the number of efficient DMUs (67%) and a relative growth in the mean value of total efficiency (3.6%) by considering RE concept. In other words, RE plays a significant role in the promotion of system performance. The results also showed that teamwork had the highest impact on the railway system performance among the RE-associated factors. The Spearman test was performed to validate the results of this study.

Most studies of the robustness of PTN have focused on network topology and considered vulnerability in terms of connectivity reliability. While these studies provide insights on general design principles, there is lack of knowledge concerning the effectiveness of different strategies to reduce the impacts of disruptions. This paper proposes and demonstrates a methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of a strategic increase in capacity on alternative PTN links to mitigate the impact of unexpected network disruptions. The evaluation approach consists of two stages: identifying a set of important links and then for each identiﬁed important link, a set of capacity enhancement schemes is evaluated. The proposed method integrates stochastic supply and demand models, dynamic route choice and limited operational capacity. This dynamic agent-based modelling of network performance enables to capture cascading network effects as well as the adaptive redistribution of passenger ﬂows. An application for the rapid PTN of Stockholm, Sweden, demonstrates how the proposed method could be applied to sequentially designed scenarios based on their performance indicators. The method presented in this paper could support policy makers and operators in prioritizing measures to increase network robustness by improving system capacity to absorb unexpected disruptions.","2015-11","2024-12-01 14:36:12","2024-12-01 14:36:12","2024-12-01 14:36:12","47-61","","","81","","Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice","Planning for the unexpected","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\QHKEKIWP\Cats and Jenelius - 2015 - Planning for the unexpected The value of reserve .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its strategic importance and vulnerable location between the mountainous Kaikōura range and the Pacific Ocean make it a critical transportation route in the national transport network. The route has been a focus for understanding the resilience of transport networks from as far back as 2000, when this section was used as a pilot study in early research into transport resilience. A further resilience assessment of this section was completed as part of a national state highway resilience study in mid-2016. Subsequently, the Mw 7.8 Kaikōura earthquake struck the northeast of the South Island on 14 November 2016, triggering thousands of large landslides and causing severe disruption to the transport network. The damage and disruption caused by the earthquake was comparable to that assessed in pre-earthquake studies of the resilience of the state highway. Landslides and embankment failures caused the most damage and disruption to the transport infrastructure, with the Main North Line railway closed for over 9 months and State Highway 1 closed for over a year. Post-earthquake landslides and debris flows triggered by storms caused additional damage and disruption during the recovery phase. Post-earthquake assessment of the corridor resilience was carried out to identify measures to enhance resilience as part of the recovery works. These measures included realigning the road and rail away from the steep hillsides, engineered works to reduce the potential for slope failure, and engineered works to reduce the potential for inundation of the corridor. The resilience assessments also enabled tactical and operational measures to be put in place to ensure safety while allowing the recovery operations to proceed in the context of enhanced risk associated with storm events and potential aftershocks.","2021-06-01","2024-12-01 14:36:43","2024-12-01 14:36:43","2024-12-01 14:36:43","69-81","","2","54","","BNZSEE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\QAZWWLFD\Mason and Brabhaharan - 2021 - Characterisation of transport resilience and measu.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Climate resilience is an emerging issue at contaminated sites and hazardous waste sites, since projected climate shifts (e.g., increased/decreased precipitation) and extreme events (e.g., flooding, drought) could affect ongoing remediation or closure strategies. In this study, we develop a reactive transport model (Amanzi) for radionuclides (uranium, tritium, and others) and evaluate how different scenarios under climate change will influence the contaminant plume conditions and groundwater well concentrations. We demonstrate our approach using a two-dimensional reactive transport model for the Savannah River Site F-Area, including mineral reaction and sorption processes. Different recharge scenarios are considered by perturbing the infiltration rate from the base case, as well as considering cap failure and climate projection scenarios. We also evaluate the uranium and nitrate concentration ratios between scenarios and the base case to isolate the sorption effects with changing recharge rates. The modeling results indicate that the competing effects of dilution and remobilization significantly influence pH, thus changing the sorption of uranium. At the maximum concentration on the breakthrough curve, higher aqueous uranium concentration implies that sorption is reduced with lower pH due to remobilization. To better evaluate the climate change impacts in the future, we develop the workflow to include the downscaled CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) climate projection data in the reactive transport model, and evaluate how residual contamination evolves through 2100 under four climate Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. The integration of climate modeling data and hydro-geochemistry models enables us to quantify the climate change impacts, assess which impacts need to be planned for, and therefore assist climate resiliency efforts and help guide site management.","2021-08-02","2024-12-01 14:37:00","2024-12-01 14:37:00","2024-12-01 14:37:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","Groundwater hydrology/Modelling approaches","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\WI5GPXC3\Xu et al. - 2021 - Reactive Transport Modeling for Supporting Climate.PDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, there is a need for efficient solutions aimed at prioritizing the order of construction of the multiple lines or modes that a transport operator might want to construct to increase its offer. For this purpose, we propose in this paper a simple and quick-to-compute methodology, called REINFORCE, to prioritize the order of construc‑tion of the lines of a newly designed transport mode by maximizing the transport network performances and enhancing the transport network resilience, as described by complex networks metrics.

Human activities as the construction of buildings, transportation routes, dams, and artiﬁcial canals have often been a major factor for the increasing damage due to slope failures. When recovery actions are not durable from an economic point of view, increasing the population’s awareness is the key strategy to reduce the effects of natural and anthropogenic events.

The built environment and transport infrastructure of an urban form determine the extent to which low-impact adaptations to these constraints are possible and hence the resilience of residents to fuel price shocks and constraints. This paper introduces the concept of active mode accessibility (AMA), defined as the proportion of activities that can be reached by active modes alone, given the population demographics of the study area. AMA is characterized by the underlying geographic form of an urban area and its transport networks. High AMA means that the resident transport activity system can be served with minimal energy input; consequently resilience to fuel shocks and constraints is greater. The AMA method is based on accessibility analysis and extends the depth of the analysis with energy-based activity modeling and defines a measure of energy accessibility. The paper introduces a spatial method for calculating the AMA within a selected study area and a geographic information system–based tool for applying the method, and presents two case studies. Central Christchurch, New Zealand, gives an AMA of 100% because the city has a high density of destinations and a wide range of local facilities available for every activity. The satellite township of Rolleston gives a significantly lower AMA of 59%, principally because of a lack of local preschool and high school facilities and an insufficient diversity of destinations for some activities.","2011-01","2024-12-01 14:37:19","2024-12-01 14:37:19","2024-12-01 14:37:19","72-80","","1","2242","","Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board","Quantifying Transport Energy Resilience","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\6N6D2ACF\Rendall et al. - 2011 - Quantifying Transport Energy Resilience Active Mo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To be resilient, transportation systems should recover quickly and function effectively after disasters. However, reconstruction of road links has to be implemented as a multistage procedure due to limited budget. Hence, guidance needs to be provided on when and where to reconstruct to maintain high system performance during the recovery period. This article proposes a novel multi-stage network design model for identifying the optimal reconstruction sequence that maximizes the resilience of transportation networks with budget constraints. To achieve this, resilience is quantiﬁed as the sum of the recovery ratios of system performance during reconstruction. A day-to-day trafﬁc assignment model and a logit-based loading model are integrated to describe the trafﬁc ﬂow evolution during reconstruction. The model is implemented on two test transportation networks. The results show that the optimal reconstruction sequence leads to the most signiﬁcant improvement in postdisaster performance. Stability analysis indicates that effective trafﬁc control strategies are necessary to ensure the ﬂow stability during reconstruction.","2015-01-02","2024-12-01 14:37:34","2024-12-01 14:37:34","2024-12-01 14:37:34","91-105","","1","7","","Journal of Transportation Safety & Security","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\V964H5IF\Ye and Ukkusuri - 2015 - Resilience as an Objective in the Optimal Reconstr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rising transport demand increases the congestion in railway networks and thus they become more interdependent and more complex to operate. Also, an increasing number of disruptions due to system failures as well as climate changes can be expected in the future. As a consequence, many trains are cancelled and excessively delayed, and thus, many passengers are not reaching their destinations which compromises customers need for mobility. Currently, there is a rising need to quantify impacts of disruptions and the evolution of system performance. This review paper aims to set-up a ﬁeld-speciﬁc deﬁnition of resilience in railway transport and gives a comprehensive, up-todate review of railway resilience papers. The focus is on quantitative approaches. The review analyses peer-reviewed papers in Web of Science and Scopus from January 2008 to August 2019. The results show a steady increase of the number of published papers in recent years. The review classiﬁes resilience metrics and approaches. It has been recognised that systembased metrics tend to better capture eﬀects on transport services and transport demand. Also, mathematical optimization shows a great potential to assess and improve resilience of railway systems. Alternatively, data-driven approaches could be potentially used for detailed ex-post analysis of past disruptions. Finally, several rising future scientiﬁc topics are identiﬁed, spanning from learning from historical data, to considering interdependent critical systems and community resilience. Practitioners can also beneﬁt from the review to understand a common terminology, recognise possible applications for assessing and designing resilient railway transport systems.","2020-07-03","2024-12-01 14:37:38","2024-12-01 14:37:38","2024-12-01 14:37:38","457-478","","4","40","","Transport Reviews","Resilience in railway transport systems","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\LF9VNDUG\Bešinović - 2020 - Resilience in railway transport systems a literat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We employ a small network as a numerical study to conduct resilience analysis, and variable message signs with different compliance rates are utilized to induce trafﬁc ﬂows for alternative routes when a given link of the network is subject to mild (25%), moderate (50%), severe (75%) capacity reduction. The results show that variable message signs can apparently improve the resilience of the network in most of cases, and a larger compliance rate of variable message signs does not necessarily lead to better rapidity of recovery for approximation equilibrium.

This paper studies the resilience enhancement strategy by line hardening and DG placement when outages occur in distribution lines and trafﬁc lights in the coupled power distribution system and urban transportation system (PDS-UTS). A tri-level optimization model is formulated with a limited budget for line hardening and DG placement to minimize the cost of load shedding and aggregated vehicle travel time. The ﬁrst level determines line hardening and DG placement strategies, the second level searches for the worst case of faulted lines that would maximize load shedding and aggregated vehicle travel time, and the third level minimizes the corresponding costs of load shedding and travel. In urban transportation system, a dynamic user equilibrium model is established in a cell transmission model and solved by a linear complementarity approach. As the number of unavailable lines and trafﬁc lights are deﬁnite in the inner-most level, the coupled PDS-UTS is considered as two decoupled systems. Accordingly, the tri-level model is converted into an equivalent bi-level model through Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions, which is then solved by a greedy search method. Case studies corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed model and relevant solution method for the coupled PDS-UTS.","2019-07","2024-12-01 14:37:56","2024-12-01 14:37:56","2024-12-01 14:37:56","4068-4079","","4","10","","IEEE Trans.

First, we represent transportation networks by an undirected graph with the nodes as cities and edges as traffic roads. Because the survival ability of transportation of a pair of cities depends on the number of independent paths between them, the resilience of a city node can be evaluated by the weighted average number of reliable independent paths with all other city nodes in the networks. The network resilience can then be calculated by the weighted sum of all node resilience. Based on the recommended approaches, the resilience of a transportation network is evaluated and analyzed.

Resilience evaluation of trafﬁc networks can help enhance the management of IoT-based smart transportation. Currently, most of the research work on resilience evaluation is devoted to a single type of trafﬁc network. However, in reality, urban trafﬁc networks are complex, and various types of trafﬁc networks are often highly interrelated and need to be evaluated concurrently. To address the above problem, this paper proposed a method for resilience evaluation of urban bus-subway trafﬁc networks for potential applications in IoT-based smart transportation in megacities. The essential idea behind the proposed method is to combine the urban bus network with the subway network and present a model of an urban bus-subway hybrid trafﬁc network, rather than a single type of trafﬁc network. In the proposed method, (1) an urban bus-subway hybrid trafﬁc networks model is established; (2) four metrics such as the degree centrality and clustering coefﬁcient are used to identify vital nodes in the hybrid trafﬁc network; and (3) four indicators such as the network efﬁciency and sensitivity are used to analyze the network resilience. The effectiveness of the proposed method is veriﬁed by the application of urban bus-subway hybrid trafﬁc networks in Beijing. The proposed method can be potentially applied to optimize the resource allocation of important nodes in an urban hybrid trafﬁc network, which is of great interest for enhancing the management of IoT-based smart transportation in megacities.","2021-11-15","2024-12-01 14:38:06","2024-12-01 14:38:06","2024-12-01 14:38:06","25061-25074","","22","21","","IEEE Sensors J.","","","","","","","","en","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/downloads/license-information/IEEE.html","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\4NXGIU8I\Qi et al. - 2021 - Resilience Evaluation of Urban Bus-Subway Traffic .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigate whether and how travelers recover to their pre-pandemic mobility level. We find that public transport use recovered slowly, as urban mobility is a result of urban functionality, transport supply, social context, and inter-personal differences. In general, urban mobility represents a strengthened revisiting tendency during COVID-19, as individual’s trips occur within a more limited space. We confirm that travel behavior resilience differs by groups. Commuters recover travel frequency and length, while older people decrease frequency but retain activity space.

Results indicated that, according to experts working on complex transportation projects, a traditional investment process, where the focus of the capital investment is solely on reducing traffic delays, can greatly reduce the resiliency of the network.

The resilience of infrastructures is almost always affected by severe calamitous events, even though the damages are not always visible. Researchers have developed several methods, which have been recently adopted by the transportation sector, to define the physical condition and/or performance deviations of affected infrastructures by measuring their resilience. Throughout literature, few studies focus on comparative analysis based on the advantages and disadvantages of these models; therefore, the goal of this paper is to identify and analyze frameworks, based on their applicability and dimensions. To achieve this goal, a thorough review of literature was conducted to define the resilience concept and identify the frameworks. Several of the most recent resilience-measuring models and methods that relate to the technical aspects of the resilience of transportation infrastructures, including the Critical Infrastructure Resilience Decision Support System (CIR-DSS), and Cox’s proportional hazards regression model and resilience optimization model, were identified to conduct a comparative analysis. Findings of this study will help researchers explore current gaps in research on resilience of the transportation infrastructure sector, and will guide researchers in developing a resilience measurement model that incorporates all dimensions. This study will also be of great help to researchers and practitioners, as they adopt appropriate methods to measure the severity of damages and identify proactive strategies to reduce unintended consequences of disruptive events.","","2024-12-01 14:39:07","2024-12-01 14:39:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\WI96WXEA\Nipa et al. - Comparative Analysis of Strengths and Limitations .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As these infrastructures develop, becoming critical to support millions of people, their resilience in the face of disasters and attacks becomes an increasing concern to the engineers and stakeholders. Using a graph theory and complex network approach, we conducted an empirical study on the resilience of ﬁve metro, or subway systems selected globally. A multi-phase resilience framework was implemented from the resilience cycle concept, including preparedness, robustness, recovery, and adaptation. It also incorporated the historical ﬂow data into the resilience analysis to account for user behavior impacts. The paper demonstrates a systematic comparison of ﬁve metro networks and explores trends in each resilience phase. Generally, diverse performances were observed among the ﬁve metro networks, with the Singapore metro showing the best resilience. It is robust to both random disruption and targeted attacks. Analysis suggests its advantage may come from both its moderate heterogeneous topology and the ﬂow pattern, exhibiting the smallest average travel distance. Besides, the result highlights the signiﬁcance of commuters’ relocation behavior between neighboring stations in the recovery stage. For the adaptation from a long-term perspective, we developed a screening tool to investigate the impact of the network expansion on the existing part of network by mapping its relationship with the characteristics of the newly connected nodes. In general, the observation of the networks’ different behaviors in ﬂow-weighted analysis symbolizes that ﬂow is necessary for consideration in the resilience design of real-world transportation systems.","2022-08","2024-12-01 14:39:12","2024-12-01 14:39:13","2024-12-01 14:39:12","12688-12699","","8","23","","IEEE Trans.

Population growth has enhanced transportation demand while urbanization and climate change have intensified urban floods. However, despite the clear need to develop actionable insights for improving the resilience of critical urban lifelines, the theory and methods remain underdeveloped. Furthermore, as infrastructure systems become more intelligent, security experts point to the growing threat of targeted cyber-physical attacks during natural hazards. Here we develop a hypothesis-driven resilience framework for urban transport NoNs, which we demonstrate on the London Rail Network (LRN). We find that topological attributes designed for maximizing efficiency rather than robustness render the network more vulnerable to compound natural-targeted disruptions including cascading failures. Our results suggest that an organizing principle for post-disruption recovery may be developed with network science principles. Our findings and frameworks can generalize to urban lifelines and more generally to real-world spatial networks.","2020-06-25","2024-12-01 14:39:16","2024-12-01 14:39:16","2024-12-01 14:39:16","10350","","1","10","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\Y4ZI7VTI\Yadav et al. - 2020 - Resilience of Urban Transport Network-of-Networks .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the resulting abrupt increase in the travel demand during evacuation causes severe congestions across the transportation system, which thereby interrupts other commuters' regular activities. In this article, a bilevel mathematical optimization model is formulated to address this issue, and our research objective is to maximize the transportation system resilience and restore its performance through two network reconfiguration schemes: contraflow (also referred to as lane reversal) and crossing elimination at intersections. Mathematical models are developed to represent the two reconfiguration schemes and characterize the interactions between traffic operators and passengers. Specifically, traffic operators act as leaders to determine the optimal system reconfiguration to minimize the total travel time for all the users (both evacuees and regular commuters), while passengers act as followers by freely choosing the path with the minimum travel time, which eventually converges to a user equilibrium state. For each given network reconfiguration, the lower‐level problem is formulated as a traffic assignment problem (TAP) where each user tries to minimize his/her own travel time. To tackle the lower‐level optimization problem, a gradient projection method is leveraged to shift the flow from other nonshortest paths to the shortest path between each origin–destination pair, eventually converging to the user equilibrium traffic assignment. The upper‐level problem is formulated as a constrained discrete optimization problem, and a probabilistic solution discovery algorithm is used to obtain the near‐optimal solution. Two numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in restoring the traffic system performance.","2019-09","2024-12-01 14:39:25","2024-12-01 14:39:25","2024-12-01 14:39:25","2054-2075","","9","39","","Risk Analysis","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\6FEX2FIN\Zhang et al. - 2019 - Network Reconfiguration for Increasing Transportat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A spectrum of resilience and sustainability metrics are defined herein and a research methodology is described to evaluate them probabilistically. A case study demonstration on the road network in the Memphis Metropolitan Statistical Area (MMSA) for a probabilistic suite of earthquake scenarios shows that the correlation between network resilience and sustainability is dependent on the hazard level as well as the graphical abstraction of the real road network. While some correlations are observed between temporal sustainability metrics, such as missed trips and traffic emissions, and resilience metrics, like total travel distance and time, the correlation weakens as the network resolution becomes more sparse.

This cross-layer interface is provided by a thin internetwork protocol (PoMo) that supports heterogeneity at trust and policy boundaries.

The concept of a repair line set is proposed and is determined with the aim to minimize the total loss and maximize the resilience increment of the line to the system.

Being resilient becomes a key property for CIs, which are constantly exposed to threats that can undermine safety, security, and business continuity. Nowadays, a variety of approaches exist in the context of CIs’ resilience research. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review on the approaches that have a complete qualitative dimension, or that can be used as entry points for semi-quantitative analyses. The study aims to uncover the usage of qualitative research methods through a systematic review based on PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). The paper identifies four principal dimensions of resilience referred to CIs (i.e., techno-centric, organisational, community, and urban) and discusses the related qualitative methods. Besides many studies being focused on energy and transportation systems, the literature review allows to observe that interviews and questionnaires are most frequently used to gather qualitative data, besides a high percentage of mixedmethod research.

Previous research in this regard has focused on the technical and engineering aspects of infrastructure construction. The risk management of resilient transport infrastructure is poorly considered, and little has been done to quantify the capacity of transport infrastructure to recover from the impact of natural disasters under varying conditions. This paper applies Cox’s proportional hazards regression model to determine the rate of recovery and cumulative probability that recovery occurs for transport infrastructure across regional areas in New South Wales, Australia. Data for postdisaster reconstruction projects over the period 1992–2012 are used to analyze recovery rate against geographic region, natural disaster type and post-disaster transport infrastructure reconstruction cost. Results demonstrate that transport infrastructure recovered slowest when the failure is the result of a ﬂood rather than bushﬁre or storm, and in regions with a riverine geography. To validate the accuracy of the model, a bootstrap resampling technique is used.

While resilience itself is well understood, decisions that would enhance resilience are interdependent and involve various stakeholders. There are indices for evaluating community resilience, but these have the shortcoming that they compare between political entities, such as counties. Therefore, one cannot ascertain that a county is truly resilient. In addition, natural disasters depend on the landscape and thus have no relation to the political boundaries. Our metric aims to capture the information into a Community Intrinsic Resilience Index (CIRI), which embodies the resilience level of four critical sectors: transportation, energy, health and socio-economic. As a case study, we computed CIRI for the counties within New Jersey. Results showed that within NJ, CIRI ranged from 63 to 80%. A post-disaster CIRI, following a scenario of flooding, revealed that two coastal counties would have low CIRI values due to the reduction in the road area and/or the GDP (local economy shut down) to below minimum values.

Those of the operational performances include transport services scheduled along particular routes, their seating capacity, and corresponding transport work/capacity. The indicators of economic performances include the costs of cancelled and long-delayed transport services imposed on the main actors/stakeholder involved—the rail operator(s) and users/passengers. The indicators of social-economic performances reflect the compromised accessibility and consequent prevention of the user/passenger trips and their contribution to the local/regional/national Gross Domestic Product. Modeling resulted in developing a methodology including two sets of analytical models for: (1) assessing the dynamic resilience of a given rail network, i.e., before, during, and after the impacts of disruptive event(s); and (2) estimation of the indicators of particular performances as the figures-of-merit for assessing the network’s resilience under the given conditions.

These layers include, but are not limited to, bus network, metro network, and road network. Formally, a multiplex network is a multilayer graph in which the same set of nodes are connected by diﬀerent types of relationships. Intra-layer relationships denote the road segments connecting stations of the same transportation mode, whereas inter-layer relationships represent connections between diﬀerent transportation modes within the same station. Given a multi-modal transportation system of a city, we are interested in assessing its quality or eﬃciency by estimating the coverage i.e., a portion of the city that can be covered by a random walker who navigates through it within a given time budget, or steps. We are also interested in the robustness of the whole transportation system which denotes the degree to which the system is able to withstand a random or targeted failure aﬀecting one or more parts of it. Previous approaches proposed a mathematical framework to numerically compute the coverage in multiplex networks. However solutions are usually based on eigenvalue decomposition, known to be time consuming and hard to obtain in the case of large systems. In this work, we propose MUME, an eﬃcient algorithm for Multi-modal Urban Mobility Estimation, that takes advantage of the special structure of the supra-Laplacian matrix of the transportation multiplex, to compute the coverage of the system. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of MUME on both synthetic and real transportation networks of various cities such as Paris, London, New York and Chicago. A future goal is to use this experience to make projections for a fast growing city like Doha.","2018-12","2024-12-01 14:40:28","2024-12-01 14:40:28","2024-12-01 14:40:28","14","","1","7","","EPJ Data Sci.","Resilience analytics","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\HEGLGCNJ\Baggag et al. - 2018 - Resilience analytics coverage and robustness in m.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using theoreti‑cal findings from behavioral sciences, this paper makes the first steps towards formali‑zation of the adaptive capacity of resilience of the air transport system with a particular focus on its ability to anticipate. To this end, an expressive logic-based language called Temporal Trace Language is used. The proposed approach is illustrated by a case study, in which anticipatory mechanisms are implemented in an agent-based airport terminal operations model, to deal with a disruptive scenario of unplanned and challenging passenger demand at the security checkpoint. Results showed that the timing of an adaptive action could have a significant influence on reducing the risk of saturation of the system, where saturation implies performance loss. Additionally, trade-off relations were obtained between cost, corresponding to the extra resources mobilized, and the benefits, such as a decrease in risk of saturation of the passenger queue.","2018-12","2024-12-01 14:40:32","2024-12-01 14:40:33","2024-12-01 14:40:32","7","","1","6","","Complex Adapt Syst Model","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\QTG5JVMS\Blok et al. - 2018 - Formal and computational modeling of anticipation .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the resilience of interconnected infrastructure systems is imperative to effectively manage such disruptions. This study investigates the role of interconnectedness in enhancing the resilience of public transportation systems in Hong Kong, a city heavily reliant on public transit. Our results demonstrate that interconnected transportation systems improve resilience by reducing topological vulnerabilities, increasing attack tolerance, and enhancing post-disruption interoperability. Findings also identify the potential to integrate vulnerable systems for greater robustness and highlight the marginal benefits of enhancing intermodal transfer. Strengthening interconnectedness among modes of urban public transit fosters a safe-to-fail system, presenting a distinct resilience-by-design approach.

In particular, this study performs a rigorous probabilistic analysis on the seismic resilience of a transportation network in Istanbul, Turkey. The analysis accuracy is enhanced by considering, along with the structural damage of roadways, the additional disruption mode of network performance caused by the debris falling from damaged objects in their vicinity. Moreover, we obtain the results as a map of resilience measure, which enables us to investigate the disruption inequality across the study area and identify critical factors that govern the system resilience. To enable such sophisticated probabilistic analysis, a Bayesian network (BN) model is developed that involves various types of information from the hazard process to the performance of structures and systems.

Aiming to support the resilience assessment of transportation infrastructure in three representative regions: Sichuan–Chongqing, Yangtze River Delta, and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei-Shandong, rainfall data over 40 years in the three regions are collected, and the temporal distribution of rainfall are analyzed. Prediction equations of rainfall are established. For the purpose of this, the probabilistic density function (PDF) is assigned to the rainfall by fitting the frequency distribution histogram. Using the assigned PDF, the rainfall data are transformed into standard normal space where regression of prediction equations is performed and the prediction accuracy is tested. The results show that: (1) The frequency of rainfall in the three regions follows a lognormal distribution based on which the prediction equations of rainfall can be established in standard normal space. The error of regression shows no remarkable dependence on self-variables, and the significance analysis indicates that the equations proposed in this paper are plausible for predicting rainfalls for the three regions. (2) The Yangtze River Delta region has a higher risk of rainstorm disaster compared to the other two regions according to the frequency of rainfall and the return period of precipitation concentration.

This theoretical stance also suggests that organisations wanting to enhance their potential for resilience begin by measuring their operational safety performance against four key potentials, these being: the Potential to Anticipate; the Potential to Respond; the Potential to Learn; and the Potential to Monitor. Furthermore, to measure these four key resilience constructs, organisations have been recommended to use a Resilience Assessment Grid (RAG) developed as part of this theory. However, scarce research appears to have been conducted that bridges the theory and practice divide on just how organisations can pragmatically measure their current performance against these four resilience potentials using the RAG. Therefore, this research was interested in undertaking a pilot study using RAG theory in order to examine an organisation’s four resilience potentials, and was conducted within a large road transport organisation in Australia. Results indicated that measuring both the four individual potentials and a combination of the four potentials was possible using a RAG and proved eﬀective in providing a snapshot of operational safety system resilience concepts. Recommendations on how to increase organisational resilience potentials were provided to ensure future safety endeavours would enhance the organisation’s potential to be resilience in the face of system variability and operational demands.","2020-11-13","2024-12-01 14:40:53","2024-12-01 14:40:54","2024-12-01 14:40:53","51","","4","6","","Safety","Measuring Resilience Potentials","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\XZTICDFT\Klockner and Meredith - 2020 - Measuring Resilience Potentials A Pilot Program U.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper explores institutionalizing resilience and adaptation to climate change in the intergovernmental transportation planning processes that address bridge infrastructure in the Northeastern United States (USA), specifically in Vermont and Maine. The research presented here relies on nine interviews with policy-makers and planners, a survey of transportation project prioritization criteria, development of a longitudinal bridge funding database, and its integration with publicly available geospatial data. It presents a novel spatial analysis methodology, a modified version of which could be adopted by transportation agencies for prioritizing scarce adaptation funds. Although transportation agencies are undertaking a variety of mitigation activities to address business-as-usual needs, climate change adaptation and resilience efforts remain underprioritized. Adaptation is a global concern, but impacts vary dramatically between regions and require localized solutions. Bridges and culverts, which are especially vulnerable to climate-induced flooding impacts, have complex maintenance and design processes and are subject to convoluted adaptation planning procedures. Critical gaps in resources and knowledge are barriers to improved adaptation planning. Restructuring the transportation project prioritization procedures used by planning organizations to explicitly include adaptation may provide a novel strategy to institutionalize resilience in transportation. These procedures must be considered in the context of the intergovernmental networks that exist to support transportation infrastructure. Although these networks will likely vary across countries, the approaches introduced here to study and address transportation infrastructure adaptation may be applied to many settings.","2017-01","2024-12-01 14:40:58","2024-12-01 14:40:58","2024-12-01 14:40:58","175-198","","1","22","","Mitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change","Adapting bridge infrastructure to climate change","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\25MEYRTH\Schulz et al. - 2017 - Adapting bridge infrastructure to climate change .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It distributes the trafﬁc of a demand between two nodes according to a speciﬁc load balancing function over several disjoint paths and redistributes it if one of them fails. The load balancing functions can be optimized so that backup capacity in the network is optimally shared by multiple demands in various failure scenarios. As a result, resilience against all link and node failures can be achieved with only little extra capacity and in capacitated networks more protected trafﬁc can be carried with the SPM than with other resilience mechanisms. The SPM is rather simple which facilitates its deployment in practice. This chapter explains the SPM in detail, distinguishes it from other, similar mechanisms, shows how the load balancing functions can be optimized, and illustrates the superior performance of the SPM.","","2024-12-01 14:41:06","2024-12-01 14:41:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\592RVGEV\Menth - Self-Protecting Multipaths (SPM) Efﬁcient Resilie.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To prepare for these events, decision makers need guidance to determine what investments are likely to improve the resiliency of their networks, which are often hampered by limited resources. To date, such guidance has been primarily qualitative. This paper presents a methodology to quantify resiliency, under preevent conditions, by use of a fuzzy inference approach. This methodology expands on previous work by the authors and others, by refining the definitions of key variables, adjusting model interactions, and increasing transparency between metrics. The paper includes a case study in which the methodology is applied to a disruptive event in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

The research is important since transport may act as a facilitator of social, economic, and environmental development. Based on data retrieved from Eurostat, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and World Bank, the output of ﬁxed-effects regressions for EU-28 countries over 1990–2016 reveals that road, inland waterways, maritime, and air transport infrastructure positively inﬂuence gross domestic product per capita (GDPC), though a negative link occurred in the case of railway transport. As concerning investments in transport infrastructure, the empirical results exhibit a positive impact on economic growth for every type of transport, except inland waterways. Besides, emissions of CO2 from all kind of transport, alongside other speciﬁc air pollutants, negatively inﬂuence GDPC. The fully modiﬁed and dynamic ordinary least squares panel estimation results reinforce the ﬁndings. Further, in the short-run, Granger causality based on panel vector error correction model pointed out a unidirectional causal link running from sustainable economic growth to inland waterways and maritime transport of goods, albeit a one-way causal link running from the volume of goods transported by air to GDPC. As well, the empirical results provide support one-way short-run links running from GDPC to investments in road and inland waterway transport infrastructure. In addition, a bidirectional short-run link occurred between carbon dioxide emissions from railway transport and GDPC, whereas unidirectional relations with economic growth were identiﬁed in the case of carbon dioxide emissions from road and domestic aviation. In the long-run, a bidirectional causal relation was noticed between the length of the railways lines, investments in railway transport infrastructure, and GDPC, as well as a two-way causal link between the gross weight of seaborne goods handled in ports and GDPC.","2018-08-16","2024-12-01 14:41:52","2024-12-01 14:41:52","2024-12-01 14:41:52","2900","","8","10","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\3ZS5L9DF\Gherghina et al. - 2018 - Empirical Evidence from EU-28 Countries on Resilie.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To reflect on real-world developments more accurately, new thinking and modelling approaches are necessary to bridge academic models with physical transport processes. This paper introduces a computational model which computes movements of agents in geographically referenced space. The model captures stochastic parallel processes for each mode, and simulates decentralized delivery performance of each order in terms of cost, time and emissions at an operational level. Furthermore, we study the routing of individual orders and their responsiveness to disruptions. Computational experiments are performed within a case study which concerns imports of retail goods by unimodal truck transport from France to Belgium.

Motivated by the high cumulative impact of recurrent perturbations on transportation systems, we have investigated resilience quantiﬁcation as a performance assessment method for high-probability low-impact (HPLI) disturbances such as traﬃc congestions. Resilience-based metrics are supplementary to conventional travel-time-based indices in literature. However, resilience is commonly quantiﬁed as a scalar variable despite its multi-dimensional nature. Accordingly, by hypothesizing increased information gain in performance assessment, we have investigated a multi-dimensional approach (mD-Resilience) for resilience quantiﬁcation. Examining roadways’ resilience to recurrent congestions as a contributor to sustainable mobility, we proposed to measure resilience with several attributes that characterize the degradation stage, the recovery stage, and possible recovery paths. These attributes were integrated into a performance index by using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) as a non-parametric method. We demonstrated the increased information gain by quantifying the performance of major freeways in Los Angeles, California using Performance Measurement System (PeMS) data. The comparison of mD-Resilience approach with the method based on area under resilience curves showed its potential in distinguishing the severity of congestions. Furthermore, we showed that mD-Resilience also characterizes performance from the lens of delay and bottleneck severities.","2020-06-15","2024-12-01 14:42:09","2024-12-01 14:42:09","2024-12-01 14:42:09","4879","","12","12","","Sustainability","mD-Resilience","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\78GJ6BTE\Khaghani and Jazizadeh - 2020 - mD-Resilience A Multi-Dimensional Approach for Re.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the aim of improving the sustainability of the GBA, this paper presents a novel view of vulnerability and resilience of integrated transportation networks within an urban agglomeration. According to complex network theory, the integrated transportation network model of the GBA was established. Various scenarios were considered to improve the overall level of defensive ability, including random failures, targeted attacks and natural hazards. Vulnerability and resilience assessment models were developed to investigate the inﬂuences on the whole network. Finally, a simulation analysis was conducted on the GBA to examine the variations in network performance when faced with diﬀerent attack scenarios. The results indicate that the transportation network of the GBA is more vulnerable and has less resilience to targeted attacks, while natural hazards had little inﬂuence on the performance, to a certain extent. Moreover, the betweenness recovery strategy seemed to be the best choice for every attack scenario.","2020-09-09","2024-12-01 14:42:13","2024-12-01 14:42:13","2024-12-01 14:42:13","7410","","18","12","","Sustainability","Analysis of Transportation Network Vulnerability and Resilience within an Urban Agglomeration","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\2XIPK3YM\Chen and Lu - 2020 - Analysis of Transportation Network Vulnerability a.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many users have started to prefer traveling by private cars, which is against the sustainability policies of the European cities. The necessity of gaining a deeper understanding of road users’ travel habit changes, their feelings on public transport use, and their perceptions of using sustainable urban mobility modes has emerged for future transport planning. Considering these facts, the study in this paper aimed to investigate the inﬂuence of the COVID-19 pandemic on road users’ perceptions, needs, and use of sustainable travel modes (i.e., public transport, walking, and cycling). An online survey was carried out during the period from March to May 2020 in the case study area, Sicily of Southern Italy. Regarding the population of the case study, the survey was representative, with 431 individuals. The survey included variables, namely gender, age, city of residence, private car ownership, walking and cycling frequency before and during the pandemic, public transport use frequency for leisure activities before and during the pandemic, need for remote working, and the stress and anxiety perception of using public transport during the pandemic. The analysis started with descriptive statistics and it was followed by correlation analysis in order to explore the characteristics of the dataset and relationship between variables. It was found that these were not statistically signiﬁcantly correlated at a 95% conﬁdence level. An ordinal regression model was applied for determining the predictions. The results suggested that women were less likely to walk during the pandemic than men. Participants were more likely to resume remote work even after the second phase in order to reduce their daily travel needs and keep their isolation. Participants have expressed a positive opinion on the use of micromobility during pandemic situations. These results can be considered as a basis for sustainable urban planning and a guide for decision-makers who aim to encourage the use of public transport, walking, cycling, and micromobility.","2020-10-23","2024-12-01 14:42:18","2024-12-01 14:42:18","2024-12-01 14:42:18","8829","","21","12","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\PDJKV55J\Campisi et al. - 2020 - The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Resilience .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The input criteria to train and check the models for the neural resilience network are the demographic variables, the geospatial data, trafﬁc parameters, and infrastructure inventories.

This study examined the resilience plans of 11 coastal US cities to understand 1. How FEWT systems were considered within resilience plans and, 2. How nexus principles or elements critical to a nexus approach were incorporated within resilience plans. A “Nexus Index” was created to examine the incorporation of nexus principles, which included partnerships and collaborations, reference to other plans or reports, discussion of co-beneﬁts, cascading impacts, and inclusion of interdisciplinary or cross-silo principles. These principles were used to score each action within the resilience plans. Results showed that only eight actions (1% of all actions across the 11 plans) focused on the connections among FEWT systems within the resilience plans. The transportation system was associated with the most actions, followed by the energy system, water system, and the food system. While FEWT systems were not consistently included, there was evidence from the Nexus Index that the plans included elements critical to a nexus approach, such as the inclusion of partnerships and reference to co-beneﬁts with the actions they designed to build resilience. The heterogeneity among the systems that each plan emphasized reﬂects the heterogeneity among the challenges that each city faces. While context-speciﬁc differences in resilience plans across cities are expected, some consistency in addressing certain infrastructural needs and their nexus interactions may greatly beneﬁt and improve the implementation of resilience planning.","2021-06-02","2024-12-01 14:42:36","2024-12-01 14:42:36","2024-12-01 14:42:36","6316","","11","13","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\MJBHUZYS\Raub et al. - 2021 - An Analysis of Resilience Planning at the Nexus of.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To display the range of effects that can be achieved in urban mobility through the proper implementation of shared e-scooter systems, a systematic literature review and a case study were performed. It was found that this shared system can help cities with environmental issues, such as reducing air pollution, reducing inequality in access to transport, promoting money-saving, and improving mobility resilience.

What is the degree of loss of urban transportation resilience (UT resilience) under different extreme event intensities, and how long will it take for the entire system to restore balance? In the future, if extreme weather events become more frequent and intense, what trends will urban transportation resilience show? Considering these problems, the current monitoring methods for transportation resilience under the inﬂuence of extreme events are lacking, especially the monitoring of the temporal and spatial dynamic changes of transportation resilience under the inﬂuence of compined extreme events. The development of big data mining technology and deep learning methods for spatiotemporal predictions made the construction of spatiotemporal data sets for evaluating and predicting UT resilience-intensity indicators possible. Such data sets reveal the temporal and spatial features and evolution of UT resilience intensity under the inﬂuence of compound extreme weather events, as well as the related future change trends. They indicate the key research areas that should be focused on, namely, the transportation resilience under climate warming. This work is especially important in planning efforts to adapt to climate change and rising sea levels and is relevant to policymakers, trafﬁc managers, civil protection managers, and the general public.","2022-03-25","2024-12-01 14:42:44","2024-12-01 14:42:44","2024-12-01 14:42:44","3880","","7","14","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\UYR7Z2ZR\Ji et al. - 2022 - The Impact of Climate Change on Urban Transportati.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indigenous peoples of Siberia have always been mobile using diverse traditional ways across the taiga. During the Soviet period, the transition to settled life, along with technological development and the emergence of new modes of transport, such as off-road cars, snowmobiles, and motor boats, signiﬁcantly affected the level of population mobility, including remote areas where people are engaged in traditional nature management. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, there were signiﬁcant changes and reductions in the subsidies of transportation systems for remote terrains that made them isolated. Transport connectivity has been realized through rare plane ﬂights (once a month or less) or by cars on dirt roads (actually off-road) that take several days of travel. Siberian territories rich with natural resources, low population density, and weak infrastructure might be attractive for mining companies. Being difﬁcult to access not only for the local population, but also for industrial companies, the territories imply the allocation of a signiﬁcant share of road construction and transport costs in the cost items of miners and processors. The problems of sustainability and resilience of the indigenous peoples of Siberia require special attention when restructuring transport communications, but they have practically not been studied before. Methods of in-depth and group interviews with local residents were used. Based on comparative geographic and statistical analysis and generalization of data, network and problem approaches applied for various sources and ﬁeld materials (including in-depth and group interviews), the factors of sustainability and resilience, which the indigenous communities of three remote Siberian territories pin their hopes on in the context of the transformation of transportation infrastructure, have been identiﬁed. If geographic remoteness remains an unchanged fact, the expansion of desired transport accessibility (mainly due to investments by industrial companies) is associated by locals with the possibility of additional income related to provision of services, the emergence of new types of employment of the population that have not been observed before, and the implementation of new transport modes to support traditional activities.","2022-05-20","2024-12-01 14:42:47","2024-12-01 14:42:48","2024-12-01 14:42:47","6253","","10","14","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\WE3NK2YL\Kuklina et al. - 2022 - Sustainability and Resilience of Indigenous Siberi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of paper is to provide a graded assessment of urban transportation resilience to help city managers target policies and plans. Wuhan, the first city in China to be severely hit by COVID-19, was selected as the case study for this research. Based on an extensive survey of the travel characteristics of residents in central urban areas, the concept of “travel mode shift” was combined to classify residents into four modes, including non-motorized conventional travel, non-motorized over-distance travel, motorized adaptable travel and motorized non-substitutable travel. The potential transportation stoppages in different levels of epidemic impact were then divided into three scenarios, corresponding to each of the city’s three levels of transportation resilience. The concept of MWD (Maximum Willingness Distance) in active travel mode was further developed, which was divided into WMWD (Walking Maximum Willingness Distance) and RMWD (Riding Maximum Willingness Distance). Finally, a hierarchical assessment model of urban transportation resilience is developed based on the MWD distance threshold. Besides, the average income level of urban residents was also included in the assessment system. The following research conclusions were drawn: (1) The degree of transportation resilience in Wuhan showed an “S-curve” relationship with RMWD, with thresholds at RMWD = 2.5 km, 11 km and 23 km respectively. (2) The resilience of transportation in the suburbs of the city was weaker than in the city center, and the gap between the two increases as the RMWD increases, but the share of motorized transportation in short distance trips in the city center was still higher than desirable. (3) The upper-income groups in the city had more flexible travel options, while the lower income groups were less resilient to travel. Based on the results of the study, it is recommended that city managers can identify areas of low resilience and critical distance thresholds that may lead to sudden changes in transportation resilience in the event of a sudden disaster. This will lead to the development of improved policies. The special needs of socially disadvantaged groups should also be taken more into account in this process.","2022-09-02","2024-12-01 14:42:53","2024-12-01 14:42:54","2024-12-01 14:42:53","10957","","17","14","","Sustainability","A Reflection on the Response to Sudden-Onset Disasters in the Post-Pandemic Era","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\PZKUI6Y9\Wang et al. - 2022 - A Reflection on the Response to Sudden-Onset Disas.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we introduce the Self-Organizing Feature Mapping (SOFM) model, construct the urban trafﬁc congestion zoning index system based on the resilience and vulnerability of urban trafﬁc systems, and establish the urban trafﬁc congestion zoning model, which is divided into four, ﬁve, six, and seven according to the different structures of competition layer topology. The four vulnerability damage capacity indicators of trafﬁc volume, severe congestion mileage, delay time and average operating speed, and two resilience supply capacity indicators of trafﬁc systems, namely, road condition and number of lanes, are used as model input vectors; the data of Guiyang city from January to June 2021 are used as data sets to input four SOFM models for training and testing and the best SOFM model with six competitive topologies is constructed. Finally, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to identify the optimal partition boundary line for trafﬁc congestion. The results show that the four models predict the urban trafﬁc congestion zoning level correctly over 95% on the test set, each trafﬁc congestion zoning evaluation index in the urban area shows different obvious spatial clustering characteristics, the urban trafﬁc congestion area is divided into six categories, and the city is divided into 16 zoning areas considering the urban trafﬁc congestion control types (prevention zone, control zone, closure control zone).

Studying the impact of the transportation infrastructure level on urban resilience is related to the future development of a city. Based on panel data for China’s three major urban agglomerations from 2008 to 2019, this paper uses the spatial econometric model to explore the spatial spillover effect of transportation infrastructure on urban resilience. The results show that, due to its spillover effect, intra-regional transportation infrastructure promotes the urban resilience of cities around Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei and the Pearl River Delta, while it only promotes the urban resilience of local cities in the Yangtze River Delta. Inter-regional transportation infrastructure not only inhibits the local urban resilience of Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei but also reduces the urban resilience of surrounding cities. However, the impact on the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta is not obvious. To promote the overall resilience level in three major urban agglomerations in China, this paper argues that it is urgently required to improve the quality of urban road trafﬁc facilities and optimize the structure of intercity transportation to promote the development of transportation infrastructure and urban resilience.

Multimodal transport, with its advantages of speed, large volume and multiple modes, has increasingly gained attention from countries worldwide. However, multimodal transport logistics is a complex and systematic process. Its smooth flow depends not only on the transport itself, but also on the efficient supervision of customs and other government departments at ports. This study employs the theory and method of a super-network to establish a model of multimodal transport logistics, which includes TIR-based sea–road multimodal transport and customs supervision relationships. Structural and resilience-related characteristics of the super-network are analyzed, and performance parameters of the super-network are proposed. A simulation analysis is conducted, and based on the results, countermeasures to improve the resilience and promote risk management of multimodal transport logistics in the post–COVID-19 era are suggested.

The ability of an infrastructure system to withstand, to adapt to, and to recover rapidly from extreme events is paramount in the ability to serve users. The effects of historical climatic events have resulted in a growing concern for preparedness against such hazards, specifically in coastal communities. The continuing function of society and its economy relies heavily on an accessible transportation network. Roads, highways, railroads, ports, and airports make up a complex infrastructure vital for the travel of goods and people. Extreme events of climatic source that disturb the transportation network affect all aspects of daily life, both directly and indirectly. To estimate the resilience of coastal transportation networks to extreme events, topological graph properties are measured as the nodes and links of a network are removed to simulate failures and closures due to extreme climatic events. The transportation network of the New York City metropolitan area, the most populous and crucial urban area in the United States, was chosen as a case study. The presented approach provides a tool for transportation agencies to identify the most critical sections of the network and to establish pre-event hazard mitigation strategies or to plan for postevent recovery actions with the goal of increasing the resiliency and decreasing the down time of transportation networks.","2015-01","2024-12-01 14:43:21","2024-12-01 14:43:21","2024-12-01 14:43:21","29-36","","1","2532","","Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\7ZCB4EFW\Testa et al. - 2015 - Resilience of Coastal Transportation Networks Face.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aim to identify and rank the links most critical to the overall performance of the road network, taking into account the dynamic properties of road traffic and focusing on day-to-day disruptions. As a metric to quantify road network performance in the presence of such disruptions, we use the increase in overall travel cost. We then compare our approach with purely topological approaches. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the different analyzed metrics. We prove that link ranking varies greatly depending on the metric. Specifically, the proposed stress testing methodology can produce very accurate results by taking into account demand and congestion, but requires computationally intensive simulations, being therefore prohibitive even on medium-sized networks. Conversely, purely static topological metrics can be inaccurate if they do not take into account traffic demand and network dynamics. Our study highlights the need for joining traditional traffic-agnostic topological resilience analysis with demand-aware dynamic stress testing techniques.","2018-12","2024-12-01 14:43:25","2024-12-01 14:43:25","2024-12-01 14:43:25","54-65","","1","2672","","Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board","Road Network Resilience","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\5S6SSG9S\Gauthier et al. - 2018 - Road Network Resilience How to Identify Critical .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A case study related to a Portuguese automotive supply chain is presented. Two strategies widely used to mitigate disturbance effects on supply chains were considered and six scenarios were designed.

To better understand the relationship between the two approaches, we ﬁrst investigate whether they correlate by comparing trafﬁc volume and node centrality. Second, we assess the impact of the two approaches on the connectivity and resilience of a transportation network; connectivity is measured by the relative size of the giant component, and resilience is measured by the network’s adaptive capacity (the amount of extra ﬂow it can handle). The urban road system of Isfahan (Iran) is used as a practical case study. Overall, we ﬁnd that trafﬁc volume indeed correlates with node centrality. In addition, we ﬁnd that the weighted degree of a node, i.e., the sum of the capacities of its incident links (for small disruptions) and node betweenness (for large disruptions), best captures node criticality. Nodes with high weighted degree and betweenness should therefore be given higher priority to enhance connectivity and resilience in urban street systems. Regarding link criticality, roads with higher capacities showed a more important role as opposed to betweenness, ﬂow, and congestion.","2019-08","2024-12-01 14:43:37","2024-12-01 14:43:37","2024-12-01 14:43:37","1127-1141","","4","46","","Transportation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\NHQ3DYJ5\Akbarzadeh et al. - 2019 - The role of travel demand and network centrality o.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The outcomes of this research constitute a useful decision-making support tool that allows detecting disruption scenarios at different risk-aversion levels based on the quantification of the structural robustness with the use of the genome method and observing the scope of disruption propagation.

Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) represents the most promising technology solution for nextgeneration enterprise networks, being able to increase network agility and reduce costs. In this paper, we present an experimental SD-WAN solution capable of running and optimizing delaysensitive high-priority services, such as real-time video streaming, while minimizing downtime caused by network failures. This solution comprises a monitoring and a traffic engineering system for SD-WAN. The first consists of a Transport-layer Passive Monitoring (TPM) system based on extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology with the goal of monitoring TCP flows; the second consists of an application, running inside the SD-WAN controller, with the goal of orchestrating the network traffic in consideration of the monitoring measurements by ensuring rapid recovery and resilience in case of unexpected congestion events. We validate our solution over two SD-WAN testbeds: the first is hosted in our laboratory at Politecnico di Milano, while the second is deployed in a municipal network of an Italian city. Results show that our SD-WAN solution can increase the overall service availability while meeting the stringent QoS requirements of delay-sensitive services.","2022-09","2024-12-01 14:43:50","2024-12-01 14:43:50","2024-12-01 14:43:50","2652-2663","","3","19","","IEEE Trans.

It discusses the arduous conditions of this daily commute, as well as the ways in which PUTCO buses became central to mobilising against KwaNdebele’s independence in 1986. More specifically, this article demonstrates how the daily exhaustion of commuters, the poor design of these buses, their lack of safety and high fares in the 1970s and 1980s have continued into the post-apartheid present. Not only does this demonstrate the resilience of apartheid infrastructure – seen as a form of resolute­ ness and resistance to change – but it also highlights the resilient citizenship required from commuters in the post-apartheid period. Resilient citizenship – where responsibilised citizen-subjects in South Africa are required to be adaptable to apartheid infrastruc­ ture – has emerged through the state’s embrace of a neoliberal regime. Characterised by privatisation and reducing state expendi­ tures, this regime has, in relation to apartheid’s infrastructure, given rise to techniques of government that shift responsibility onto individuals by imposing strategies of adaptability.

Then based on the simulation of typhoon scenarios, we assess the resilience of both single-mode systems and a complementary system of multiple modes. This method is applied to the high-speed rail network and civil aviation network in China under different typhoon intensity scenarios. Results show the different resilience characteristics of the two networks, and more importantly unveil the complementary effect between the two modes when suffering from damages.

We estimated partial proportional odds models to show the factors responsible for the enterprises’ vulnerability and resilience to unforeseen shock. The perspective refers to the total sample size and the division into two subgroups: micro and small and medium enterprises. To justify the results, we calculated a set of statistical indicators and tests. These models enable separating enterprises according to the vulnerability level. Transport enterprises occurred significantly vulnerable to the COVID-19 crisis, particularly the demand shock. The only factor that influenced resilience was the decrease in fuel prices, which allowed a cost reduction.

This article provides an overview of recent research on vulnerability and resilience of transport systems. Deﬁnitions of vulnerability and resilience are formulated and discussed together with related concepts. In the increasing and extensive literature of transport vulnerability studies, two distinct traditions are identiﬁed. One tradition with roots in graph theory studies the vulnerability of transport networks based on their topological properties. The other tradition also represents the demand and supply side of the transport systems to allow for a more complete assessment of the consequences of disruptions or disasters for the users and society. The merits and drawbacks of the approaches are discussed. The concept of resilience offers a broader socio-technical perspective on the transport system’s capacity to maintain or quickly recover its function after a disruption or a disaster. The transport resilience literature is less abundant, especially concerning the post-disaster phases of response and recovery. The research on transport system vulnerability and resilience is now a mature ﬁeld with a developed methodology and a large amount of research ﬁndings with large potential practical usefulness. The authors argue that more cross-disciplinary collaborations between authorities, operators and researchers would be desirable to transform this knowledge into practical strategies to strengthen the resilience of the transport system.","2015-11","2024-12-01 14:44:40","2024-12-01 14:44:40","2024-12-01 14:44:40","16-34","","","81","","Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\VF8XC6JD\Mattsson and Jenelius - 2015 - Vulnerability and resilience of transport systems .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A daily rainfall runoff and transport model of the Sacramento River Basin of northern California was developed to simulate streamflow and suspended sediment transport to the Bay‐Delta for the next century (water years, WY2010–2099). The model was calibrated to historical streamflow and sediment data and applied using 10 Global Climate Models with two representative concentration pathways (RCP) each for WY1980–2099 from the IPCC 5th Assessment Report. Results indicate average increases in peak streamflow of +58% and +66% for the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 ensembles, respectively, by mid‐century and +62 and +96% by end‐of‐century. Sediment loads increased by +39% and +69% by end‐of‐century. Suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) increased on average by +4.6% and +6.7% for RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively, by end‐of‐century. Individual scenario results varied, and statistically significant increasing trends of sediment loads to the Bay‐Delta were found for the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 ensembles and five individual scenarios. Increased suspended sediment loads may have negative effects such as contaminant transport but also have positive effects that help protect against sea level rise, increase turbidity and fish habitat, and sustain wetland habitats in the Bay‐Delta.           ,              Plain Language Summary             The health of the San Francisco Bay‐Delta depends on a sediment supply that has been recently declining.

Climate change is expected to exacerbate these problems by further increasing rainfall intensity and the frequency of extreme rainfall events. Due to the risks posed by these changing rainfall patterns, a shift in the approach to infrastructure planning and management is needed for many ﬂoodprone communities, particularly in regard to managing streams and ﬂoodplains in urban areas. This study proposes a framework for systematically evaluating stream restoration in combination with engineered improvements to culvert and bridge crossings to identify and optimize options for mitigating extreme events in urban areas. To illustrate the methodology, extensive hydraulic modeling was conducted to test four diﬀerent strategies for reducing ﬂooding along a channelized and armored stream, Big Ditch, located in Goldsboro, North Carolina, USA. The results indicate that neither ﬂoodplain restoration nor infrastructure modiﬁcation alone could alleviate ﬂooding along Big Ditch. Rather, a combination approach would be required to mitigate ﬂooding, which could result in substantial beneﬁts for storms in excess of the 100-year event. The results suggest that shifting to a multi-faceted approach to improve resiliency to extreme events could improve public safety and reduce future damages due to ﬂooding.","2020-06-06","2024-12-01 14:44:57","2024-12-01 14:44:57","2024-12-01 14:44:56","1620","","6","12","","Water","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\P5JW6M6V\Doll et al. - 2020 - A Framework for Planning and Evaluating the Role o.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a comprehensive literature review on the topic is still lacking. As such, this paper presents a review of recent resilience studies for road transportation networks under hydrological hazards. Various sources of hydrological hazards in resilience studies are concluded in this review with corresponding models that can generate inundation depth for the networks. Adverse impacts due to hazards are differentiated into two categories— structural damage and functionality loss. The resilience evaluation models are discussed to understand the assessment approaches and indicators that have been adopted in recent studies. Furthermore, the resilience studies focused on improvement strategies are described in detail, including the mitigation, relief, and restoration strategies in different phases of hazards.

To handle uncertainties in line outages and flooded roads incurred by extreme rainfalls, a tri-level robust EPP model is proposed to determine the optimal emergency preparedness plan immunized against the worst-case realization of uncertainties.

It reflects the network’s ability to mitigate shocks, provide alternatives, and rapidly recover to a target performance level. Earthquakes can cause the transportation network to experience severe disruptions that significantly reduce network resilience. To prevent long-term closures after earthquakes, the development of innovative approaches for their rapid restoration is necessary. This paper uses the recent developments in accelerated bridge construction (ABC) techniques as a means to enhance the rapid recovery of the system. ABC techniques often come with increased initial construction costs. In most cases, the additional cost is offset by the improvement of the network performance. To examine the efficiency of ABC techniques on the rapid recovery and on the network performance after earthquakes, the direct and indirect costs during the entire recovery period were analyzed and the relationship between network recovery time and network performance was estimated under different construction techniques. Additionally, the effect of using the incentive method to reduce the repair time was studied. The results show that the use of ABC techniques and the incentive method have great potential to minimize the transportation network’s indirect losses, improve network performance, increase the network’s resilience by decreasing recovery time, and justify the additional initial costs associated with these techniques.","2018-12","2024-12-01 14:45:42","2024-12-01 14:45:42","2024-12-01 14:45:42","138-147","","1","2672","","Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\64C92EUK\Zhang et al. - 2018 - Application of Novel Recovery Techniques to Enhanc.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Like the self-healing ability of a biological unit from diseases, transportation can also recover spontaneously from various disturbances. To describe this recovery, we define the resilience metric as the spatiotemporal congestion cluster, which can be used for other network systems. Based on large-scale GPS datasets, we reveal that the recovery behavior of transportation from congestion is governed by three scaling laws for all of the congestion scales. These scaling laws are found independent of microscopic details, including fluctuation of traffic demand and corresponding management. Our results of resilience scaling can help to better characterize and improve the adaptation and recovery of city traffic from various perturbations.           ,              The concept of resilience can be realized in natural and engineering systems, representing the ability of a system to adapt and recover from various disturbances. Although resilience is a critical property needed for understanding and managing the risks and collapses of transportation systems, an accepted and useful definition of resilience for urban traffic as well as its statistical property under perturbations are still missing. Here, we define city traffic resilience based on the spatiotemporal clusters of congestion in real traffic and find that the resilience follows a scale-free distribution in 2D city road networks and 1D highways with different exponents but similar exponents on different days and in different cities. The traffic resilience is also revealed to have a scaling relation between the cluster size of the spatiotemporal jam and its recovery duration independent of microscopic details. Our findings of universal traffic resilience can provide an indication toward better understanding and designing of these complex engineering systems under internal and external disturbances.","2019-04-30","2024-12-01 14:45:48","2024-12-01 14:45:48","2024-12-01 14:45:48","8673-8678","","18","116","","Proc.

Nonetheless, whereas regional economic resilience is frequently discussed in the political and research agenda for civil infrastructure, project-level analysis integrating resilience into decision making is still scarce even though the built environment, and in particular transportation systems, are recognized as crucial elements affecting regional economic resilience. Consequently, the assessment of the role of transportation infrastructure in economic resilience is limited. This paper discusses literature on the intersection between transportation and economic resilience planning, describes the findings from an expert opinion survey about economic resilience and transportation, and proposes a theoretical framework to incorporate resilience indicators into the decision-making process for transportation projects at the sketch-planning level (i.e., the initial level of decision making). A case study for State Road 3 (SR-03) in Indiana is presented to demonstrate an application of the conceptual framework. The survey revealed that experts are aware of the concept of economic resilience, but the concept is not necessarily applied in transportation planning. In addition, the reviewed studies and survey results showed that planning for economic resilience requires the consideration of regional characteristics, including industrial diversity and human capital, in addition to transportation accessibility.

Road networks, as a part of a transport system, are among the most important lifeline systems. Urban road networks experience serious congestion because of infrequent major disruptions. Due to these disruptions the traffic system performance is reduced and the travel time and emissions in a road network are increased. This paper describes a method for optimising traffic signal settings (i.e. green times and offsets) to assist drivers to avoid partial or complete blockages, to minimise the travel time or carbon dioxide emissions in the case of disruptions in road networks. This method involves applying the Cross-Entropy opti­ misation method, along with a semi-dynamic approach, to optimise traffic signal control in disrupted road networks. This includes investigating two objective functions: minimising the travel time or minimising carbon dioxide emissions. To achieve this, short-term blockages are tested with different durations (a degradation for 4 minutes up to full hour) and level of capacity reductions (i.e. 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%). The results for minimising the travel time, in the Cambridge (UK) network, show that applying signal optimisation reduces the travel time by almost 6% and carbon dioxide emissions by almost 8% for a complete capacity reduction at the most congested node, compared to not optimising the signal settings.","2021-01","2024-12-01 14:46:03","2024-12-01 14:46:03","2024-12-01 14:46:03","117-128","","","22","","Travel Behaviour and Society","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\shrey\Zotero\storage\AQBUVQ5G\Abudayyeh et al. - 2021 - Traffic signal optimisation in disrupted networks,.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the unique contributions of this review article is that it compiled the key resilience indices that were analyzed to quantify resilience. This review revealed that the majority of the scholarly articles on the topic of transportation system resilience published since 2006, were focused on the resilience of the roadway-based transportation system, and vulnerability was one of the most explored resilience indices in evaluating transportation system resilience.
